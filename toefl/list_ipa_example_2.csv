I mean, how come Halley's is still there? After four and a half billion years ． How could it be? Well, the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit, since once a comet gets into an orbit that keeps it coming in close to the Sun quite frequently．Well, that comet's probably not going to be around too much longer"
