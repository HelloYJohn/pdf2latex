GALILEO AND HIS TELESCOPE 
Early in the seve nteenth centu ry, the Italian scientis t Galileo Galil ei helped disprove the 
Earth-centered model of the solar system and other ideas popu lar since Aristotle (384 B.C.-322 
B.C.) and the ancient Greeks. Galileo used his telescope to support the Sun-centered model 
proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in the previous centu ry. He did not invent optical lense s, 
nor was he the first to use them in a teles cope. Rather , he promo ted his astronomical ideas 
by exploiting the novelty and shock value of telescopic observa tions. Galileo's repor t of his 
observat ions in his book Sidereus Nuncius (The Starry Messenger) was widely circula ted and 
broug ht him fame. 
By Galile o's time , glass lenses had been in use for about 300 years. Their origins are not 
clear , but with them, eyeg lass makers could correct defects of vision. In 1609 Galileo heard that a 
Dutchman had constructed a spyglass that made distant objects appear to be nearb y. Although 
Galileo had little experience with optics, he immed iately worked to dupl icate the instrument and 
succeeded in constructing an optical device that made objects appear thirty times closer than 
when viewed with the naked eye. He put the device to astronomical use at once. Within a few 
weeks in 1609 and 1610 , he made a series of astron omical discoveries that marked a new era in 
astronomy . Although Galileo was not the first person to build a telescope, he first recognized that 
the telescope increased our power to perceive reality. 
When Galileo turned his telescope to the Moon, he saw that the Moon's surface does not 
conform to Aristotle's ideal for a perfect heavenly body. Rather than being smooth and spherical, 
it is rough, with chains of mountains and valle ys and man y craters. Galileo then determined the 
heigh t of a lunar mountain from the length of its shadow: roughly six kilome ters (nearly 20,000 
feet) was the aston ishing (and correct) result. Galileo next peered at the stars. His instrument 
fragmented the faint band of the Milky Way into innum erable stars, more than can be distingui shed 
with the unaided eye. This observation refuted the Ari stotelian idea that the sky cont ains a set 
numb er of stars that cannot chan ge. 
Then Galil eo hit on what he consider ed to be his most important discovery-f our new 
"planets. " Actua lly they were not new planets but rather were the four brig htest moons of 
Jupiter. (At least seventeen moons are now known.) To his amazement, Galileo found that these 
four bodies revolved around Jupiter. From conti nuous nigh tly observati ons, he estim ated the 
orbital periods of Jupiter' s satellites. Here he found another argu ment agains t tradition, for 
Jupiter and its satellites resembled a mini ature solar syste m. This fact required a second center 
of rev olution in the cosmos and contr adic ted the Aristotelian doct rine that only the center 
of the universe-Ea rth-c ould be the center of revolution. Historical ly, Galile o may not have 
been the first to report on moons orbiting Jupiter. An old Chin ese record notes that Kan Te, an 
astronomer in China in the fourth century B.C., made many observations of Jupiter. In one of his 
books, Kan Te states that Jupiter looked as if it had "a small reddish star attached to it." This may 
record the brightest of Jupiter's moons , which can, under ideal circumstanc es, be visible to the 
unaided eye. If so, Kan Te recorded this moon some 2,000 years before Galileo obser ved it with 
a telescope. p

Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius was published on March 12, 1610, in Latin. Because it attracted 
immediate attention from scholars in many countries, it was quickly reprinted and read by 
intellectuals all over Europe. These telescopic discoveries, especially the news of Jupiter's moons, 
not only brought fame to Galileo but also created a demand for the telescopes he produced in his 
workshop. He was still cautious in print: although he used his observations to demolish Aristotle's 
idea of the cosmos, he did not openly advocate the Copernican scheme or support it with his 
observations. Critics quickly spurned Galileo's work by invoking atmospheric phenomena or flaws 
in the lenses. Such arguments seem strange to us today, but they appeared reasonable enough 
to seventeenth-century people. The art of lens-making was just beginning, and many lenses 
produced ghost images. (Galileo's telescopes produced images far inferior to those in a cheap

EUROPE IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY 
Europe in the eleventh century underwent enormous social, technological, and economic 
changes, but this did not create a new Europe-it created two new ones. The north was developed 
as a rigidly hierarchical society in which status was determined, or was at least indicated, by the 
extent to which one owned, controlled, or labored on land; whereas the Mediterranean south 
developed a more fluid, and therefore more chaotic, world in which industry and commerce 
predominated and social status both reflected and resulted from the role that one played in the 
public life of the community. In other words, individual identity and social community in the 
north were established on a personal basis, whereas in the south they were established on a civic 
basis. By the start of the twelfth century, northern and southern Europe were very different places 
indeed, and the Europeans themselves noticed it and commented on it. 
Political dominance belonged to the north. Germany, France, and England had large 
populations and large armies that made them, in the political and military senses, the masters 
of western Europe. Organized by the practices known collectively as feudalism', these kingdoms 
emerged as powerful states with sophisticated machineries of government. Their kings and 
queens were the leading figures of the age; their castles and cathedrals stood majestically on 
the landscape as symbols of their might; their armies both energized and defined the age. 
Moreover, feudal society showed a remarkable ability to adapt to new needs by encouraging 
the parallel development of domestic urban life and commercial networks; in some regions of 
the north, in fact, feudal society may even have developed in response to the start of the trends 
toward bigger cities. But southern Europe took the lead in economic and cultural life. Though 
the leading Mediterranean states were small in size, they were considerably wealthier than their 
northern counterparts. The Italian city of Palermo in the twelfth century, for example, alone 
generated four times the commercial tax revenue of the entire kingdom of England. Southern 
communities also possessed urbane, multilingual cultures that made them the intellectual and 
artistic leaders of the age. Levels of general literacy in the south far surpassed those of the north, 
and the people of the south put that learning to use on a large scale. Science, mathematics, 
poetry, law, historical writing, religious speculation, translation, and classical studies all began to 
flourish; throughout most of the twelfth century, most of the continent's best brains flocked to 
southern Europe. 
So too did a lot of the north's soldiers. One of the central themes of the political history of 
the twelfth century was the continual effort by the northern kingdoms to extend their control 
southward in the hope of tapping into the Mediterranean bonanza. The German emperors starting 
with Otto I (936-973), for example, struggled ceaselessly to establish their control over the cities 
of northern Italy, since those cities generated more revenue than all of rural Germany combined. 
The kings of France used every means at their disposal to push the lower border of their kingdom 
to the Mediterranean shoreline. And the Normans who conquered and ruled England established 
outposts of Norman power in Sicily and the adjacent lands of southern Italy; the English kings also 
hoped or claimed at various times to be, either through money or marriage diplomacy, the rulers 
of several Mediterranean states. But as the northern world pressed southward, so too did some 
of the cultural norms and social mechanisms of the south expand northward. Over the course p

p of the twelfth century, the feudal kingdoms witnessed a proliferation of cities modeled in large 
degree on those of the south. Contact with the merchants and financiers of the Mediterranean 
led to the development of northern industry and international trade (which helped to pay for 
many of the castles and cathedrals mentioned earlier). And education spread as well, culminating

WHAT IS A COMMUNITY? 
The Black Hills forest, the prairie riparian forest, and other forests of the western United 
States can be separated by the distinctly different combinations of species they comprise. It is 
easy to distinguish between prairie riparian forest and Black Hills forest-one is a broad-leaved 
forest of ash and cottonwood trees, the other is a coniferous forest of ponderosa pine and white 
spruce trees. One has kingbirds; the other, juncos (birds with white outer tail feathers). The 
fact that ecological communities are, indeed, recognizable clusters of species led some early 
ecologists, particularly those living in the beginning of the twentieth century, to claim that 
communities are highly integrated, precisely balanced assemblages. This claim harkens back 
to even earlier arguments about the existence of a balance of nature, where every species is 
there for a specific purpose, like a vital part in a complex machine. Such a belief would suggest 
that to remove any species, whether it be plant, bird, or insect, would somehow disrupt the 
balance, and the habitat would begin to deteriorate. Likewise, to add a species may be equally 
disruptive. 
One of these pioneer ecologists was Frederick Clements, who studied ecology extensively 
throughout the Midwest and other areas in North America. He held that within any given 
region of climate, ecological communities tended to slowly converge toward a single endpoint, 
which he called the "climatic climax." This "climax" community was, in Clements's mind, the 
most well-balanced, integrated grouping of species that could occur within that particular 
region. Clements even thought that the process of ecological succession-the replacement of 
some species by others over time-was somewhat akin to the development of an organism, 
from embryo to adult. Clements thought that succession represented discrete stages in the 
development of the community (rather like infancy, childhood, and adolescence), terminating 
in the climatic "adult" stage, when the community became self-reproducing and succession 
ceased. Clements's view of the ecological community reflected the notion of a precise balance 
of nature. 
Clements was challenged by another pioneer ecologist, Henry Gleason, who took the opposite 
view. Gleason viewed the community as largely a group of species with similar tolerances to the 
stresses imposed by climate and other factors typical of the region. Gleason saw the element 
of chance as important in influencing where species occurred. His concept of the community 
suggests that nature is not highly integrated. Gleason thought succession could take numerous 
directions, depending upon local circumstances. 
Who was right? Many ecologists have made precise measurements, designed to test the 
assumptions of both the Clements and Gleason models. For instance, along mountain slopes, 
does one life zone, or habitat type, grade sharply or gradually into another? If the divisions are 
sharp, perhaps the reason is that the community is so well integrated, so holistic, so like Clements 
viewed it, that whole clusters of species must remain together. If the divisions are gradual, perhaps, 
as Gleason suggested, each species is responding individually to its environment, and clusters of 
species are not so integrated that they must always occur together. 
It now appears that Gleason was far closer to the truth than Clements. The ecological 
community is largely an accidental assemblage of species with similar responses to a particular 
climate. Green ash trees are found in association with plains cottonwood trees because both can p 
A 
R

A 
p survive well on floodplains and the competition between them is not so strong that only one 
can persevere. One ecological community often flows into another so gradually that it is next to

Dire ctions: Now answer the questions. 
The Black Hills forest, the prairie riparian forest, and other forests of the western United States 
can be separated by the distinctly different combinations of species they comprise. It is easy to 
distinguish between prairie riparian forest and Black Hills forest-one is a broad-leaved forest of 
ash and cottonwood trees, the other is a conifero us forest of ponderosa pine and white spruce 
trees. One has kingbirds; the other, juncos (birds with white outer tail feathers). The fact that 
ecological communities are, indeed, recognizable clusters of species led some early ecologists, 
particularly those living in the beginning of the twentieth century, to claim that communities 
are highly integrated, precisely balanced assemblages. This claim harkens back to even earlier 
arguments about the existence of a balance of nature, where every species is there for a specific 
purpose, like. a vital part in a complex machine. Such a belief would suggest that to remove any 
species, whether it be plant, bird, or insect, would somehow disrupt the balance, and the habitat 
would begin to deteriorate. Likewise, to add a species may be equally disruptive. 
21. In paragraph 1, why does the author distinguish between prairie riparian forest and Black 
Hills forest? 
® To highlight the difference between the views of various ecologists about the nature of 
ecological communities 
® To illustrate why some ecologists tended to view ecological communities as highly 
integrated 
© To demonstrate that one forest has a greater variety of species than the other 
® To show how these two forests differ from others in the United States 
22. According to paragraph 1, what was a common claim about ecological communities before 
the early twentieth century? 
® Every species in a community has a specific role in that community. 
® It is important to protect communities by removing certain species. 
© A precise balance is difficult to maintain in an ecological community. 
® It is necessary for new species to be added quickly as ecological communities develop. TOEFL iBT® Test 4 .£t

23. According to paragraph 1, the belief in a balance of nature suggests that removing a species 
from an ecological community would have which of the following effects? 
@ It would reduce competition between the remainin g species of the communi ty. 
® It would produce a different, but equally balanced, community. 
© It would lead to a decline in the community . 
® It would cause more harm than adding a species to the community. 
One of these pioneer ecologists was Frederick Clements, who studied ecology extensively 
throughout the Midwest and other areas in North America. He held that within any given 
region of climate, ecological communities tended to slowly converge toward a single endpoint, 
which he called the "climatic climax." This "climax" community was, in Clement s's mind, the 
most well-balanced, integrated grouping of species that could occur within that particular 
region. Clements even thought that the process of ecological succession-the replacement of 
some species by others over time-was somewhat akin to the development of an organism, 
from embryo to adult. Clement s thought that succession represented discrete stages in the 
development of the community (rather like infancy, childhood, and adolescence), terminating 
in the climatic "adult" stage, when the community became self-reproducing and succession 
ceased. Clements's view of the ecological community reflected the notion of a precise balance 
of nature. 
24. Which of the following best represents the view of ecological communi ties associated with 
Frederick Clements in paragraph 2? 
@ Only when all species in a community are at the reproductive stage of development is an 
ecological community precisely balanced. 
® When an ecological community achieves "climatic climax," it begins to decline. 
© All climates have similar climax communities. 
® Ecological communities eventually reach the maximum level of balance that is possible 
for their region. 
Clements was challenged by another pioneer ecologist, Henry Gleason, who took the opposite 
view. Gleason viewed the community as largely a group of species with similar tolerances to the 
stresses imposed by climate and other factors typical of the region. Gleason saw the element 
of chance as important in influencing where species occurred. His concept of the community 
suggests that nature is not highly integrated. Gleason thought succession could take numerous 
directions, depending upon local circumstances. 
25. According to Gleason in paragraph 3, the occurrence of a species in a particular community is 
influenced by 
® unpredictable events 
® how individualistic the species is 
© the number of other species present 
® the tolerance of other species to stresses p A

Who was right? Many ecologists have made precise measurements, designed to test the 
assumptions of both the Clements and Gleason models. For instance, along mountain slopes, 
does one life zone, or habitat type, grade sharply or gradually into another? If the divisions are 
sharp, perhaps the reason is that the community is so well integrated, so holistic, so like Clements 
viewed it, that whole clusters of species must remain together. If the divisions are gradual, perhaps, 
as Gleason suggested, each species is responding individually to its environment, and clusters of 
species are not so integrated that they must always occur together. 
26. What did the ecologists in paragraph 4 hope to determine with their measurements? 
® Whether different species compete for the same environments 
® Whether habitats are sharply separated or gradually flow into each other 
© Whether succession differs in different types of habitats 
® Whether integrated communities survive better than independent communities 
It now appears that Gleason was far closer to the truth than Clements. The ecological community 
is largely an accidental assemblage of species with similar responses to a particular climate. Green 
ash trees are found in association with plains cottonwood trees because both can survive well on 
floodplains and the competition between them is not so strong that only one can persevere. One 
ecological community often flows into another so gradually that it is next to impossible to say where 
one leaves off and the other begins. Communities are individualistic.

Critical Period 
It is generall y believed that for many organisms, there is a specific time period, a 
so-called "window of opportunit y," during which the organism must receive crucial input 
from its environment in order for normal development to occur. This period is called the 
critical period. If the needed environmental input is not received during this period, the 
normal development of certain physical attributes or behaviors may never occur. In other 
words, if the organism is not provided with the needed stimulus or influence during the 
critical period, it may permanentl y lose the capacity to ever obtain a particular physical

Many people dream of owning their own business but are afraid of the risks. Instead of 
starting a new business, however, one can buy a franchise. A franchise is a license issued by a 
large, usually well-known, company to a small business owner. Under the license, the owner 
acquires the right to use the company's brand name and agrees to sell its products. In return, the 
franchising company receives a percent of the sales. 
A major problem for first-time business owners is finding reliable suppliers of the goods and 
services they need: equipment, raw materials, maintenance, etc. It is easy to choose the wrong 
supplier, and doing so can be costly. Buying a franchise eliminates much of this problem. Most 
franchising companies have already found reliable suppliers, and franchise contracts typically 
specify which suppliers are to be used. This protects franchise owners from the risk of serious 
losses. 
Another advantage of a franchise is that it can save a new business a lot of money on 
advertising. Advertising one's product to potential customers is a crucial factor in a business's 
success. A franchise owner, however, sells an already popular and recognized brand and also 
gets the benefit of sophisticated and expensive advertisin g paid by the parent company. 
Finally, a franchise offers more security than starting an independent (nonfranchise) 
business. The failure rate for starting independent businesses is very high during the first few 
years; the failure rate for starting franchises is much lower. Finding one's own way in today's 
competitive business environment is difficult, and buying a franchise allows an inexperienced 
business owner to use a proven business model.

1. To respond to this particular question, you 
should clearly state what your opinion is: do you 
prefer to take an organized tour when visiting a 
place for the first time, or do you prefer to explore 
the new place on your own? There is no "correct" 
answer to this question. Whichever option you 
prefer, your answer should be supported with 
examples. 
If you think that it is better to take an 
organized tour, you could say that a tour is better, 
especially if you do not know much about the new 
place. You might not know where to go or what to 
see. Plus, the guide will have more knowledge than 
you do. You might give a specific example of a tour 
that you have been on yourself. 
If you prefer to explore a place on your own, 
you might say that a tour would limit you, because 
you would be told where to go. There might be a 
situation where you want to stay in one place for 
a longer time, but the tour would not allow this. 
In this case, you could also give a specific example 
of a time when you explored a place on your own 
and why this was good. 
It is important to make sure that you state your 
opinion and develop your response with good 
examples and relevant details. 
Your response should be intelligible , should 
demonstrate effective use of grammar and 
vocabulary, and should be well developed and 
coherent. Your response is scored using the 
Independent Speaking Rubric (see Appendix A).

not valid. You should provide as her explanation 
either that some classes were cancelled because 
Professor Fox did not organize enough teaching 
assistants or that she missed a philosophy course 
in Europe because Professor Fox did not sign her 
paperwork in time. 
Your response should also convey the 
woman's second reason for not agreeing with the 
university's decision to make Professor Fox Dean 
of Students. The woman disagrees that Professor 
Fox works well with students. As support, she says 
that Professor Fox has an aggressive coaching style. 
She also gives an example of her friend who was 
criticized by Professor Fox when she was looking 
for emotional support. This shows that, in the 
woman's opinion, Professor Fox would not be a 
good Dean of Students. 
As you need to discuss both of the woman's 
reasons for disagreeing with the university's 
decision, you should not include too much detail 
from the reading or concentrate too much on 
one of the reasons. Give yourself enough time to 
discuss both reasons. 
Your response should be intelligible , should 
demonstrate effective use of grammar and 
vocabulary, and should be well developed and 
coherent. Your response is scored using the 
Integrated Speaking Rubric (see Appendix A). 3. To respond to this particular question you 
should first explain the idea of a critical period as 
it was presented in the reading. The critical period 
is a specific time period for many organisms. 
Organisms must receive external or environmental 
input during this critical period in order to 
develop normally. Do not spend too much time 
summarizing all of the content of the reading. 
You should then use the examples given by 
the professor to explain critical periods. In the first 
example, the professor discusses a critical period 
that affects a physical attribute. Vision in kittens 
will not develop normally if they are not exposed 
to light within the first four months of life. In the 
second example, the professor discusses a critical 
period affecting a behavior. Baby geese will adopt 
whatever large moving object they first see within 
the first two days of their lives as their parent. 
They will follow this "parent" even if it's a different 
species. That behavior cannot be changed even if a 
real goose reappears. 
You do not need to repeat all of the details 
from the reading and the lecture, but instead 
integrate points from both to answer the question 
completely. For this question, you need to give 
yourself enough time to talk about both examples. 
Your response should be intelligible, should 
demonstrate effective use of grammar and 
vocabulary, and should be well developed and 
coherent. Your response is scored using the 
Integrated Speaking Rubric (see Appendix A). 
4. This particular question requires you to 
summarize the contents of a lecture you hear. In 
your response, you should talk about exaggeration 
Writing Section 
1. What is important to understand from the 
lecture is that the professor disagrees with the 
advantages of buying franchises presented in 
the reading, namely that a franchise owner does 
not have to look for suppliers; that a franchise 
owner gets the benefit of advertising done by the 
parent company; and that franchises provide more 
security than other types of business. . ��-r;-,.· ;_ .. �1·:· /.:. Answers

in advertising, including the examples of when it is 
legal to use exaggeration and when it is not legal 
to use exaggeration. 
You should begin with a general statement 
about the lecture, such as that exaggeration in 
advertising has to be so extreme that nobody will 
believe it. If it isn't, this advertising may be illegal. 
You would then talk about the first example that 
the professor gives. An advertiser that wanted 
to make the point that its vacuum cleaner is very 
light showed it in a television ad floating in the 
air. This kind of advertisement was legal because 
no one would really believe that a vacuum 
cleaner floated in the air. 
You should then talk about the professor's 
second example. The professor says that if the 
company showed the vacuum cleaner cleaning 
a big dirty carpet in just a few seconds that is an 
exaggeration and would be unacceptable because 
someone might actually believe it. We can imagine 
someone buying the vacuum cleaner and being 
disappointed that it didn't work that well. 
You should read the question carefully and 
respond with the appropriate information. This 
question clearly directs you to talk about a time 
when it is acceptable to use exaggeration and a 
time when it is not acceptable. You should budget 
your time so that you are able to talk about both 
examples. 
Your response should be intelligible, should 
demonstrate effective use of grammar and 
vocabulary, and should be well developed and 
coherent. Your response is scored using the 
Integrated Speaking Rubric (see Appendix A). 
In your response, you should convey 
the reasons presented by the professor for 
why buying a franchise is not the best way of 
becoming a business owner. A high-scoring 
response will include the following points made 
by the professor that cast doubt on the points 
made in the reading: � Counterpointmadeinthelecture 
Since franchising companies have already selected 
reliable suppliers for franchise owners to use, a new 
franchise owner does not run the risk of working with 
unreliable suppliers. 
Franchise owners save money on advertising because 
they sell well-known brands and because they get the 
benefit of advertising paid for by the parent companies. A franchise owner is forced to use the suppliers 
identified by the parent company. Such suppliers 
often charge too much for their goods and services. A 
franchise owner cannot use cheaper suppliers that may 
be available. 
In fact, franchise owners have to pay a portion of their 
income to the parent company in return for advertising 
services. However, advertising by the parent company 
focuses on the brand and not on the owner's individual 
business. Owners would get greater benefit for less 
money if they did their own advertising. 
Buying a franchise offers very good security. The failure There is in fact an option for starting business owners

Writing Rubric (see Appendix A). A response that 
receives a score of 5 clearly conveys all three of the 
main points in the table using accurate sentence 
structure and vocabulary. 
2. To earn a top score, you should develop a 
multi-paragraph essay that responds to the issue 
of whether people learn things better from those 
at their own level-such as fellow students or 
coworkers-than from those at a higher level, such 
as teachers or supervisors. Typically an effective 
response will contain a minimum of 300 words. 
One successful way to express agreement with 
the prompt is to explain that you can learn better 
from your fellow students or coworkers-at least 
those whom you enjoy being around-because 
when these people try to teach you something, it 
will be in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere with no 
pressure. You might go on to argue that if you're 
relaxed, you'll learn better. 
A successful way to disagree with the prompt is 
to describe the advantage of learning from someone 
with expert knowledge and teaching ability; you 
may have had a teacher who is not only great at 
math, for example, but is also much more skilled 
and experienced at transmitting this knowledge to much chance of success as new franchises. 
others than a classmate of yours might be, even if 
the classmate also has tremendous knowledge of 
the subject matter. 
Keep in mind that there is no "correct" 
answer to this question. Either side of the issue 
can be supported with examples and reasons. 
It is important to make sure that you state your 
opinion and develop a response that explains 
your opinion well. The development of your 
essay is judged by how effectively you support 
your opinion; a well-developed essay will contain 
clearly appropriate reasons, examples, and details 
that illustrate your opinion. Development is not 
evaluated simply in terms of how many words you 
write. 
Your response should be well organized. 
A well-organized essay allows an evaluator to 
read from the beginning to the end of the essay 
without becoming confused. You should be 
sure not to just repeat the same information in 
different ways. 
The quality and accuracy of the sentence 
structure and vocabulary you use to express your 
ideas is also very important.
