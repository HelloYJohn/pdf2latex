WHICH HAND DID THEY USE? 
We all know that many more people today are right-handed than left-handed. Can one trace 
this same pattern far back in prehisto ry? Much of the evidence about right-hand versus left-hand 
dominance comes from stencils and prints found in rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere, and in 
many Ice Age caves in France, Spain, and Tasmania. When a left hand has been stenciled, this implies 
that the artist was right-handed, and vice versa. Even though the paint was often sprayed on by 
mouth, one can assume that the dominant hand assisted in the operation. One also has to make the 
assumption that hands were stenciled palm downward-a left hand stenciled palm upward might 
of course look as if it were a right hand. Of 158 stencils in the French cave of Gargas, 136 have been 
identified as left, and only 22 as right; right-handedness was therefore heavily predominant. 
Cave art furnishes other types of evidence of this phenomenon. Most engravin gs, for example, 
are best lit from the left, as befits the work of right-handed artists, who generally prefer to have the 
light source on the left so that the shadow of their hand does not fall on the tip of the engraving 
tool or brush. In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something, it is mostly, 
though not always, in the right hand. 
Clues to right-handedness can also be found by other methods. Right-handers tend to have 
longer, stronger, and more muscular bones on the right side, and Marcellin Boule as long ago as 
1911 noted the La Chapelle -aux-Saints Neanderthal skeleton had a right upper arm bone that was 
noticeably stronger than the left. Similar observations have been made on other Neanderthal 
skeletons such as La Ferrassie I and Neanderthal itself. 
Fractures and other cut marks are another source of evidence. Right-handed soldiers tend to 
be wounded on the left. The skeleton of a 40-or SO-year-old Nabatean warrior, buried 2,000 years 
ago in the Negev Desert, Israel, had multiple healed fractures to the skull, the left arm, and the ribs. 
Tools themselves can be revealing. Long-handed Neolithic spoons of yew wood preserved in 
Alpine villages dating to 3000 B.C. have survived; the signs of rubbing on their left side indicate that 
their users were right-handed. The late Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux consists of 
fibers spiraling to the right, and was therefore tressed by a right-hander. 
Occasionally one can determine whether stone tools were used in the right hand or the 
left, and it is even possible to assess how far back this feature can be traced. In stone toolmaking 
experiments, Nick Toth, a right-hander, held the core (the stone that would become the tool) 
in his left hand and the hammer stone in his right. As the tool was made, the core was rotated 
clockwise, and the flakes, removed in sequence, had a little crescent of cortex (the core's outer 
surface) on the side. Toth's knapping produced 56 percent flakes with the cortex on the right, and 
44 percent left-oriented flakes. A left-handed toolmaker would produce the opposite pattern. 
Toth has applied these criteria to the similarly made pebble tools from a number of early sites 
(before 1.5 million years) at Koobi Fora, Kenya, probably made by Homo hobilis. At seven sites 
he found that 57 percent of the flakes were right-oriented, and 43 percent left, a pattern almost 
identical to that produced today. 
About 90 percent of modern humans are right-handed: we are the only mammal with a 
preferential use of one hand. The part of the brain responsible for fine control and movement is located 
in the left cerebral hemisphere, and the findings above suggest that the human brain was already 
asymmetrical in its structure and function not long after 2 million years ago. Among Neanderthalers p A R A G R A p 
p A R A G R A p 
2 of 70,000-3 5,000 years ago, Marcellin Boule noted that the La Chapelle-aux-Saints individual had a 
left hemisphere slightly bigger than the right, and the same was found for brains of specimens from 
Neander thal, Gibraltar, and La Quina. 
Directions: Now answer the questions. 
We all know that many more people today are right-handed than left-handed. Can one trace 
this same pattern far back in prehistory? Much of the evidence about right-hand versus left-hand 
dominance comes from stencils and prints found in rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere, and in 
many Ice Age caves in France, Spain, and Tasmania. When a left hand has been stenciled, this implies 
that the artist was right-handed, and vice versa. Even though the paint was often sprayed on by 
mouth, one can assume that the dominant hand assisted in the operation. One also has to make the 
assumption that hands were stenciled palm downward-a left hand stenciled palm upward might 
of course look as if it were a right hand. Of 158 stencils in the French cave of Gargas, 136 have been 
identified as left, and only 22 as right; right-handedness was therefore heavily predominant. 
1. It can be inferred from paragraph 1 that even when paint was sprayed by mouth to make a 
hand stencil 
® there was no way to tell which hand was stenciled 
® the stenciled hand was the weaker hand 
© the stenciled hand was the dominant hand 
® artists stenciled more images of the dominant hand than they did of the weak 
Cave art furnishes other types of evidence of this phenomenon. Most engravings, for example, 
are best lit from the left, as befits the work of right-handed artists, who generally prefer to have the 
light source on the left so that the shadow of their hand does not fall on the tip of the engraving 
tool or brush. In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something, it is mostly, 
though not always, in the right hand. 
2. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted 
sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave 
out essential information. 
® Right-handed artists could more easily have avoided casting shadows on their work, 
because engravings in prehistoric caves were lit from the left. 
® The tips of engraving tools and brushes indicate that these instruments were used by 
right-handed artists whose work was lit from the left. 
© The best lighting for most engravings suggests that they were made by 
right-handed people trying to avoid the shadow of their hands interfering with 
their work. 
® Right-handed artists try to avoid having the brush they are using interfere with the light 
source. .. ,. TOEFL iBT® Test 4 :"!

5. According to paragraph 5, what characteristic of a Neolithic spoon would imply that the 
spoon's owner was right-handed? 
@ The direction of the fibers 
® Its long handle 
© The yew wood it is carved from 
® Wear on its left side 
6. In paragraph 5, why does the author mention the Ice Age rope found in the French cave of 
Lascaux? 
@ As an example of an item on which the marks of wear imply that it was used by a 
right-handed person 
® Because tressing is an activity that is easier for a right-handed person than for a 
left-handed person 
© Because the cave of Lascaux is the site where researchers have found several prehistoric 
tools made for right-handed people

TRANSITION TO SOUND IN FILM 
The shift from silent to sound film at the end of the 1920s marks, so far, the most important 
transformation in motion picture history. Despite all the highly visible technological developments 
in theatrical and home delivery of the moving image that have occurred over the decades since 
then, no single innovation has come close to being regarded as a similar kind of watershed. In 
nearly every language, however the words are phrased, the most basic division in cinema history 
lies between films that are mute and films that speak. 
Yet this most fundamental standard of historical periodization conceals a host of 
paradoxes. Nearly every movie theater, however modest, had a piano or organ to provide 
musical accompaniment to silent pictures. In many instances, spectators in the era before 
recorded sound experienced elaborate aural presentations alongside movies' visual images, 
from the Japanese benshi (narrators) crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to original musical 
compositions performed by symphony- size orchestras in Europe and the United States. In Berlin, 
for the premiere performance outside the Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin, film director 
Sergei Eisenstein worked with Austrian composer Edmund Meisel (1874-1930) on a musical score 
matching sound to image; the Berlin screenings with live music helped to bring the film its wide 
international fame. 
Beyond that, the triumph of recorded sound has overshadowed the rich diversity of 
technological and aesthetic experiments with the visual image that were going forward 
simultaneously in the 1920s. New color processes, larger or differently shaped screen sizes, 
multiple-screen projections, even television, were among the developments invented or tried out 
during the period, sometimes with startling success. The high costs of converting to sound and 
the early limitations of sound technology were among the factors that suppressed innovations or 
retarded advancement in these other areas. The introduction of new screen formats was put off 
for a quarter century, and color, though utilized over the next two decades for special productions, 
also did not become a norm until the 1950s. 
Though it may be difficult to imagine from a later perspective, a strain of critical opinion in 
the 1920s predicted that sound film would be a technical novelty that would soon fade from sight, 
just as had many previous attempts, dating well back before the First World War, to link images 
with recorded sound. These critics were making a common assumption-that the technological 
inadequacies of earlier efforts (poor synchronization, weak sound amplification, fragile sound 
recordings ) would invariably occur again. To be sure, their evaluation of the technical flaws in 1920s 
sound experiments was not so far off the mark, yet they neglected to take into account important 
new forces in the motion picture field that, in a sense, would not take no for an answer. 
These forces were the rapidly expanding electronics and telecommun ications companies 
that were developing and linking telephone and wireless technologies in the 1920s. In the 
United States, they included such firms as American Telephone and Telegraph, General 
Electric, and Westinghouse. They were interested in all forms of sound technology and all 
potential avenues for commercial exploitation. Their competition and collaboration were 
creating the broadcasting industry in the United States, beginning with the introduction of 
commercial radio programming in the early 1920s. With financial assets considerably greater

among entertainment and communications media, they revitalized research into recording 
sound for motion pictures. 
In 1929 the United States motion picture industry released more than 300 sound films-a 
rough figure, since a number were silent films with music tracks, or films prepared in dual 
versions, to take account of the many cinemas not yet wired for sound. At the production level, in 
the United States the conversion was virtually complete by 1930. In Europe it took a little longer, 
mainly because there were mor� small producers for whom the costs of sound were prohibitive, 
and in other parts of the world problems with rights or access to equipment delayed the shift 
to sound production for a few more years (though cinemas in major cities may have been wired 
in order to play foreign sound films). The triumph of sound cinema was swift, complete, and 
enormo usly popular.

[Kl Although music and speech had frequently accompanied film presentations before the 
1920s, there was a strong desire to add sound to the films themselves. 
[ID Japanese filmmakers had developed the technology for creating sound films before 
directors in Europe and the United States began experimen ting with sound. 
[g Because of intense interest in developing and introducing sound in film, the general use 
of other technological innovations being developed in the 1920s was delayed. 
[Q] Before the First World War, film directors showed little interest in linking images with 
recorded sound. 
[I] The rapid progress in sound technology made possible by the involvemen t of 
telecommunica tions companies transformed the motion picture industry. 
[I] The arrival of sound film technology in the United States forced smaller producers in the 
motion picture industry out of business. Directions: Read the passage. Then answer the questions. Give yourself 18 minutes to complete

WATER IN THE DESERT 
Rainfall is not completely absent in desert areas, but it is highly variable. An annual rainfall 
of four inches is often used to define the limits of a desert. The impact of rainfall upon the surface 
water and groundwater resources of the desert is greatly influenced by landforms. Flats and 
depressions where water can collect are common features, but they make up only a small part of 
the landscape. 
Arid lands, surprisingly, contain some of the world's largest river systems, such 
as the Murray-Darling in Australia, the Rio Grande in North America, the Indus in Asia, and the 
Nile in Africa. These rivers and river systems are known as "exogenous " because their sources lie 
outside the arid zone. They are vital for sustaining life in some of the driest parts of the world. For 
centuries, the annual floods of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, for example, have brought fertile 
silts and water to the inhabitants of their lower valleys. Today, river discharges are increasingly 
controlled by human intervention, creating a need for international river-basin agreement s. The 
filling of the Ataturk and other dams in Turkey has drastically reduced flows in the Euphrates, with 
potentially serious consequences for Syria and Iraq. 
The flow of exogenous rivers varies with the season. The desert sections of long rivers respond 
several months after rain has fallen outside the desert, so that peak flows may be in the dry season. 
This is useful for irrigation, but the high temperatures, low humidities, and different day lengths of 
the dry season, compared to the normal growing season, can present di fficulties with some crops. 
Regularly flowing rivers and streams that originate within arid lands are known as 
"endogenous." These are generally fed by groundwater springs, and many issue from limestone 
massifs, such as the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Basaltic rocks also support springs, notably at the 
Jabal Al-Arab on the Jordan-Syria border. Endogenous rivers often do not reach the sea but drain 
into inland basins, where the water evaporates or is lost in the ground. Most desert streambeds are 
normally dry, but they occasionally receive large flows of water and sediment. 
Deserts contain large amounts of groundwater when compared to the amounts they hold 
in surface stores such as lakes and rivers. But only a small fraction of groundwater enters the 
hydrological cycle-feed ing the flows of streams, maintaining lake levels, and being recharged 
(or refilled) through surface flows and rainwater. In recent years, groundwater has become an 
increasingly important source of freshwater for desert dwellers. The United Nations Environment 
Programme and the World Bank have funded attempts to survey the groundwater resources of 
arid lands and to develop appropriate extraction techniques. Such programs are much needed 
because in many arid lands there is only a vague idea of the extent of groundwater resources. It is 
known, however, that the distribution of groundwater is uneven, and that much of it lies at great 
depths. 
Groundwater is stored in the pore spaces and joints of rocks and unconsol idated (unsolidi fied) 
sediments or in the openings widened through fractures and weathering. The water-saturated 
rock or sediment is known as an "aquifer." Because they are porous, sedimentary rocks, such as 
sandstones and conglomerates, are important potential sources of groundwater. Large quantities of 
water may also be stored in limestones when joints and cracks have been enlarged to form cavities. 
Most limestone and sandstone aquifers are deep and extensive but may contain groundwaters that 
are not being recharged. Most shallow aquifers in sand and gravel deposits produce lower yields, p A R A G R A p

but they can be rapidly recharged. Some deep aquifers are known as "fossil" waters. The term 
"fossil" describes water that has been present for several thousand years. These aquifers became 
saturated more than 10,000 years ago and are no longer being recharged. 
Water does not remain immobile in an aquifer but can seep out at springs or leak into other 
aquifers. The rate of movement may be very slow: in the Indus plain, the movement of saline (salty) 
groundwaters has still not reached equilibrium after 70 years of being tapped. The mineral content 
of groundwater normally increases with the depth, but even quite shallow aquifers can be highly 
saline.

Subliminal Perception 
Humans are constantly perceiving visual and auditory stimuli. Sometimes our 
perception of these stimuli occurs consciously; we are aware of a stimulus and know that we 
are perceiving it. But our perception of a stimulus can also occur without our awareness: an 
image might appear and disappear before our eyes too quickly for us to notice that we saw 
it, or a sound might be too faint for us to realize that we heard it. This phenomenon-the 
perception of a stimulus just below the threshold of conscious awareness-is called sublim­
inal perception. Experiments have shown that subliminally perceived stimuli can influence

Reading Time: 3 minutes 
Jane Austen (1775-1 817) is one of the most famous of all English novelists, and today her 
novels are more popular than ever, with several recently adapted as Hollywood movies. But 
we do not have many records of what she looked like. For a long time, the only accepted image 
of Austen was an amateur sketch of an adult Austen made by her sister Cassandra. However , 
recently a professio nally painted, full-length portrait of a teenage girl owned by a mem ber 
of the Austen family has come up for sale. Although the professional pain ting is not titled 
Jane Austen, there are good reasons to believe she is the subject. 
First, in 1882, seve ral decades after Austen's death, Austen' s family gave 
permission to use the portrait as an illustration in an edition of her letters. Austen's 
family clearly recognized it as a portrait of the author . So, for over a century now , 
the Austen family itself has endor sed the claim that the girl in the portrait is 
Jane Austen. 
Second, the face in the portrait clearly resembles the one in Cassand ra's sketc h, which 
we know depicts Austen. Though somewhat amateurish, the sketch com mun icates definite 
deta ils about Austen's face. Even though the Cassa ndra sketch is of an adult Jane Austen, 
the features are still similar to those of the teenage girl in the painting. The eyebrows, nose, 
mouth, and overa ll shape of the face are very much like those in the full-leng th portrait. 
Third, although the painting is unsigned and unda ted, there is evidenc e that it was 
painted when Austen was a teenager . The style links it to Ozias Humphr ey, a society portrait 
painter who was the kind of professional the wealthy Austen family would hire. Hum phrey 
was active in the late 1780s and early 1790s, exactly the period when Jane Austen was the 
age of the girl in the painting. Listen to Track 94. 0

Use the sample Independent and Integrated 
Speaking Rubrics in Appendix A to see how 
responses are scored. The raters who listen 
to your responses will analyze them in three 
general categories. These categories are Delivery, 
Language Use, and Topic Development. All three 
categories have equal importance. 
This section includes important points 
that should be covered when answering each 
question. All of these points must be present in 
a response in order for it to receive the highest

1: Paired Choice 
Prompt 
Some people believe it's essential for a person's 
education to learn to play a musical instrument. 
Others don't believe music education is important. 
Which view do you agree with? Explain why. 
Important Points 
When answering this question, you should take 
a clear stance and explain whether you think that 
music education or playing a musical instrument is 
important. You should provide at least one reason 
to support your point of view and you should 
explain that reason in detail. It is acceptable to list 
several reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with 
the importance of music education , but you should 
not simply make a list of reasons without providing 
any support or explanation for them. High-level Response:

Rater Comments 
In this response, the speaker takes an interesting 
stance by disagreeing with both statements, though 
he expresses a clear opinion and gives support 
for that opinion. He believes that music education 
is important but not essential. He is able to give 
reasons for his point of view and support for these 
reasons. He speaks about people who "have gone 
through life successfully without having to learn a 
musical instrument." But he also mentions that 
learning a musical instrument can help with other 
skills, such as "logical thinking and math skills," and he 
references studies which have proven this point. He 
has some minor hesitations in his speech, but he is 
able to correct himself easily, and he is very easy to 
understand. 
Mid-level Response:

Rater Comments 
In this response, the speaker agrees that 
learning to play a musical instrument is essential. 
The general content of this response is very close 
to the high-level response, but this speaker does 
not express her ideas as clearly. She is able to list 
several reasons for her opinion, but her explanations 
are sometimes not well developed and therefore 
not clear ("It's very helpful to develop their brain also 
because they use in the tip of the fingers, for example, 
keyboard instrument"). Her pronunc iation is mostly 
clear and easy to understand, but her speech is not 
always smooth (she pauses frequently and uses 
words like "um"). Her word choice is sometimes 
inaccurate ("develop their emotional feeling"), and 
she makes small grammat ical errors, but she mostly 
communicates her point of view successfully. 
3: Fit and Explain 
Prompt 
The woman supports the proposal described 
in the article. Explain why she thinks it will achieve 
the university's goals. Important Points 
In your answer to this prompt, you should 
explain that the woman thinks the proposal to 
expand the student radio station will attract more 
students to the communications program and allow 
the university to make money. She thinks that more 
students will be attracted to the commun ications 
program because the proposed changes would 
allow the radio station to reach a larger audience, 
which will enable students to get real-life work 
experience and get better jobs when they graduate. 
She also thinks that the changes to the radio station 
will allow the university to make extra money by 
adding commerc ials. The extra money made from 
commerc ials can be used to offer more scholarships 
or to help fund other projects in the program. Note 
that it is not necessary to explain the technical 
aspects of expanding the broadcasting range of the 
radio station, as long as it's clear that the changes 
will allow the station to reach a larger audience. 
High-level Response: 
Listen to Track 98. 0 
Rater Comments 
The speaker clearly explains why the woman 
thinks the plan will benefit the school. Both 
goals (improving job prospects for students and 
generating money through commerc ials) are 
addressed with an appropriate level of detail. The 
response is well organized, and makes logical 
connections between the plan and its effects ("the 
staff will have ... a better chance of getting a job, 
because it'll promote interacting with people that 
are not only students, but people who live in nearby 
towns.") The idea of expanding the radio station is 
implied rather than directly stated ("right now it is 
only limited to campus and campus students"), but 
this is acceptable for this particular item since the 
prompt does not ask the speaker to describe the 
plan. Although the speaker occasional ly pauses to 
think, he speaks for long, fluid stretches between 
pauses, using appropriate intonation to express 
meaning. He uses precise vocabulary and complex 
structures accurately throughout. �/���<ii:

Rater Comments 
Although the speaker addresses all of the ,· :.} • , . .:£.. 
points and is understanda ble, vagueness and simple 
language keep this response in the middle range. 
For example, when the speaker says "more program 
would provide for opportunity for more students to 
have a real experience of what that is" the listener has 
to guess what "that" refers to. The speaker also tends 
to repeat things instead of elaborating on them. For 
example, after the sentence quoted above, he adds 
"and then they would have -get more jobs after they 
finish it because they get experience of doing it" instead 
of adding details like the fact that the station's wider 
range would allow students to work with a different 
type of audience. Sometimes the speaker's sentence 
structure limits his ability to express himself and 
make connections between pieces of informat ion. 
For example, in "they also get more money out of it 
because of the commercials," it would be better to say 
something like, "the radio station would also be able 
to earn more money because their wider audience 
would allow them to attract more commercials." 
3: General/Specific 
Prompt 
Describe what subliminal perception is and 
explain how the experim ent discussed by the 
professor illustrates this phenomenon. 
Important Points 
In this question, you should describe what 
subliminal perception is, then discuss the specific 
information from the experiment and explain 
how it is related to the general idea of subliminal 
perception. Subliminal perception is the idea that 
people perceive an image or other stimulus even 
if they are not aware that they have experienced 
it. These subliminal perceptions can influence 
people's thoughts and actions. The professor 
describes an experiment in which people were 
subliminally exposed to different photos (an angry 
or a happy boy) and then shown a second photo 
of a boy with a neutral expression. Those who 
had seen the angry boy described the neutral 
boy negatively, whereas those who had seen the 
happy boy described the neutral boy positively. This experiment shows that because of subliminal 
perception, people were influenced by a photo 
they were not aware of seeing. 
High-level Response: 
Listen to Track 100. 0 
Rater Comments 
The speaker gives a full response. She gives 
a brief definition of subliminal perception, then 
describes the experiment in more detail, with good 
accuracy. She also briefly connects the specific 
experiment to the general idea of subliminal 
perception. Although she has a prominent accent, 
her pronunc iation is clear and easy to understand. 
The response also progresses naturally from 
idea to idea, making it easier for the listener to 
follow. Occasional imprecise use of vocabulary or 
structure (for example, "people who were flashed 
with a stimulus") does not affect meaning. The 
speaker also uses self-correction effectively ("one 
group looked ... saw the picture ... the other group 
looked in ... looked at a picture"). 
Mid-level Response: Listen to 
Track 101.o 
Rater Comments 
Overall, the speaker's pronunc iation is good. 
There is some hesitation at times in the response, 
but not to the extent that it creates unnecessary 
effort for the listener. The content at the beginning 
and middle of the response is good in general, but 
she is unable to control more difficult structures, 
resulting in unclear language and confusion ("One 
teacher was shown with in order to the people during 
the experiment to watch it just a little amount of 
time"). Also, although she attempts to summar ize 
the results and connect the experiment to the 
general idea, she does not describe how the 
people in the different groups reacted differently 
(i.e., that one group described the boy negatively 
and the other group described the boy positively), 
which is a major omission of the content. 
4:Summary 
Prompt 
Using the points and examples from the talk, 
explain how substitute goods and complement 
goods influence demand for a particular product. ·-;£� .. : Answers 
Important Points 
In this item, you need to explain the ways 
the two kinds of goods-s ubstitute goods and 
complement goods-have an effect on the 
demand for particular products. You should use the 
examples of butter and margarine and of CDs and 
CD players to help explain the effect. Substitute 
goods are products that are similar enough to be 
interchangeable, so the price of one will influence 
the demand for the other. For example, margarine 
and butter are substitute goods, so if the price 
goes up for butter, then the demand goes up 
for margarine, which can be used as a butter 
substitute. Complement goods are those in which 
two products can't be used without the other, so 
the price of one will influence the demand for both 
in the same way. For instance, compact discs (CDs) 
and CD players are complement goods. If the price 
of CDs goes up, the demand will go down not only 
for CDs, but also for CD players.

While her grammar contains some minor errors, 
in other areas she is able to use fairly difficult 
grammatical constructions easily, such as "she 
stated an example ... saying that if the price of the CD 
goes up, then the demands for both the CD and the 
CD players will go down." There are a few hesitations 
during her response as she pauses to consider what 
to say, but they do not interfere greatly with the

Rater Comments 
The speaker does a fairly good job of explaining 
substitute goods and their effect on demand, but 
she runs out of time before she can finish talking 
about complement goods. She also never mentions 
the examples the professor gave. If she had not 
included an unnecessary introduction at the 
beginning-explaining that the professor is talking 
about economic theory in an economics class-she 
would have had a bit more time to finish discussing 
what the prompt required. Her speech also contains 
many hesitations, so listeners have to make an effort 
to follow her ideas. In addition, her response contains 
numerous minor grammatical errors, such as "one 
goods," "substitute of another," and "the two good." 
The responses are followed by comments from

Question 1 
Prompt 
Summarize the points made in the lecture, 
being sure to explain how they respond to the 
specific arguments made in the reading passage. 
Topic Notes 
The reading discusses a painting has been 
identified as depicting a teenaged Jane Austen, ; .. :4 TOEFL iBT® Test 4 . /:·' -� :,� .. r� 
but the lecturer presents three reasons that cast 
doubt on the reading's support of this: 
Point made in the reading 
Jane Austen's family members authorized the portrait 
for use in the 1882 edition of her letters. 
There is a strong resemblance between Cassandra's 
sketch of Jane and the portrait. 
Although we don't know who painted the portrait, 
its style is like that of a painter who was active at the 
same time the Austen family might have hired him to 
paint a teenaged Jane. 
Sample Response 
The lecture casts doubt and questions 
the evidence presented in the reading 
passage regarding a painting allegedly of 
Jane Austen. 
First, about the family's recognition of the 
painting as that of Jane's as a teenager. The lecturer 
points out that in 1882, when the Austen f amily 
authorized the use of the painting as a portrait 
of Jane in the publication of her letters, Jane had 
been dead for 70 years. Hence, the family members 
who claimed this portrait to be of Jane's probably 
have never seen her, and don't necessarily know 
how she looked. 
While the reading passage presents the 
resemblance of the face features to prove that the 
teenager in the portrait is indeed Jane, the lecturer 
sees otherwise: the teenager in the portrait could 
have been any cousin or niece of Jane. The lecturer 
claims that there was much resemblance between 
the Austen family members; specifically he names 
Mary, one of Jane's distant cousins. 
Third, according to the passage the portrait 
was attributed to Humphrey. However, the lecture Responses with scores of 4 and 5 typically 
discuss all three points in the table. 
Correspond ing point from the lecture 
Although Jane Austen's relatives did authorize the 
portrait in question for use with an edition of her 
letters, so much time had passed since Jane died that 
none of them would have actually seen the teenaged 
Jane. 
The portrait could actually be of one of the many 
female relatives (for example, Mary Ann Campion) 
who may have resembled Jane, and who were 
teenagers at the time the portrait was painted. 
A date stamped on the canvas indicates that the 
canvas was sold by William Legg, who didn't begin 
selling canvas until Jane was older than the girl in the 
portrait. 
presents other evidence relating to the date of the 
portrait based on the stamp on the canvas itself. 
According to the stamp it was sold by William Legg, 
who didn't sell canvas in London when Jane was a 
teenager. He only began selling canvas in London 
when Jane was 27 years old. 
Rater Comments 
This response earns a score of 5. It is a well 
organized response that successf ully explains 
the opposing relationship between the reading 
and the lecture. The three main points from the 
lecture are clearly identified, and the writer has 
provided relevant details for each of those main 
points. One detail about the second point is 
presented with a minor inaccuracy-MaryAnn 
Campion is described by the lecturer as a niece, 
not a cousin, of Jane Austen-but overall the 
writer's coverage of this point is sufficient to 
achieve the highest score. The very few language 
errors in the response do not interfere with the 
clear presentation of the essenti al content from 
the reading and lecture. Question 2 
Prompt 
Do you agree or disagree with the following 
statement? 
It is better to have broad knowledge of many 
academic subjects than to specialize in one specific 
subject. 
Use specific reasons and examples to support 
your answer. 
Topic Notes 
This topic requires that you compare two 
approaches to knowledge. For either approach 
you choose to write about, you should present and 
develop reasons for preferring this approach. As you 
do so, it may be helpful to identify the particular 
aspect or aspects of your life in which you think 
your choice would benefit you most; for example, 
if you indicate that it is better to specialize, you 
could explain that this will help you economically 
(for example, if you are studying to be a doctor 
and choose certain areas of specialization, you 
will probably make more money than if you were 
a general practitioner). By the same token, if you 
indicate that it is better to take broad knowledge, 
you could explain that this will help you be a well­
rounded person who can enjoy exploring many 
interests. If you believe that broad knowledge and 
specialization are equally important, it might be 
helpful to explain how having broad knowledge will 
be very useful in certain aspects of your life, while 
having specialized knowledge will be very useful in 
other aspects of your life. 
Sample Response 
To answer this question it seems to be 
necessary to make clear, for what aspect of life 
the knowledge in general should be good. On 
the one hand you might think that knowledge 
should be useful for the success in your job or at 
school. On the other hand you maybe understand 
knowledge as a part of the human existence , that 
allows us to think critically and to reflect about 
our life which includes the whole environment 
surrounding us. 
I want to respond the question from the second 
point of view. Knowledge has to be understood as 
much more than the ability to function in a special kind of business environment. Knowledge is the sum 
of all the theoretical facts and experiences a human 
being collects during his or her whole life. And from 
this position a knowledge as broad as possible must 
be accepted as the better alternative. 
I think that it will become a very big problem 
in our society when we continue to concentrate 
the whole educational system-especially the 
schools-only on teaching specific subjects. Of 
course it is actually is very important for young 
people to have the right preparation for the 
business world. But as I already said, life must focus 
on much more than the economic aspect. 
Even if you think that the preparation for 
the business world should be the main aspect of 
acquiring knowledge, you should still agree with 
the statement, because when you really analyse 
the requirements of work that are typical in our 
time, you will realize that the technologies and the 
methods change so quickly, that it would be a very 
big mistake to concentrate on a specific subject. You 
would always have the danger that if you concentrate 
on a specialized part of human knowledge, that 
part might become completely unimportant in the 
nearest future. Nowadays it seems to be useful to 
be able to program computers . Yet in some years 
computers might have the ability to program 
themselves. 
When you have a broad knowledge than you 
will be able to handle all the new things that you 
might get confronted with. And you will not only 
be able to handle them-but you will have the 
possibility to fully understand them and take part in 
their development . Not only as a passive part but as 
a creator of your own future. 
Rater Comments 
The writer of this 5-level response argues in 
favor of having broad knowledge. The response 
begins by examining some different purposes of 
acquiring knowledge and identities different areas 
or aspects of life in which we use knowledge, and 
then goes on to acknowledge that while acquiring 
specialized knowledge is useful for success at work 
or school, it is the other type of knowledge, broad 
knowledge, which is best to have. In the beginning 
of the response, this writer has associated this �;_!''.If'• TOEFL iBT® Test 4 . .i< ,.. 
type of knowledge with critical thinking skills. The 
writer then goes on to argue that if we decide to 
pursue specializ ed knowledge, there is the risk 
that it may become obsolete. The response comes 
back to the idea of critical thinking skills being 
most valuable after the writer has presented a scenario about what wo uld happen if somebody 
pursues the kind of knowledge that the writer 
is not coming out in favor of in this response. 
Although the concludi ng remark contains an error 
in structure, there are many instances of good 
facility with language use in the response.
