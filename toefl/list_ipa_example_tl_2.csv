Well, like all orbiting bodies, a comet moves faster when it's closer to the Sun．So it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood, inside the orbit of Jupiter ．Most of its time is spent way out beyond Jupiter's orbit, poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit ．Because of this, we can only see Halley's for a few months every 75 years, first on its way in toward the Sun, and then on its way out again ． Now, you remember from our previous discussion that a comet's nucleus ,its core, is made up of ice and dust, like a frozen snowball ．And as it approaches the Sun, it starts to heat up．And some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus ．The gases that vaporize from the comet, the comet never collects them back again, so on every orbit, the comet leaves part of itself behind． OK．How old is this solar system ?Four and a half billion years ．remember ?And Halley's is going around the Sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time ．So the comet should be long gone by now, right? I mean, how come Halley's is still there? After four and a half billion years ． How could it be? Well, the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit, since once a comet gets into an orbit that keeps it coming in close to the Sun quite frequently．Well, that comet's probably not going to be around too much longer",基本上，这里的想法是，一颗周期性彗星，以其非常拉长的轨道，不断地一次又一次地回来。哈雷彗星，嗯，它大约每 75 年回来一次。但在这段时间的大部分时间里，哈雷彗星在哪里呢？好吧，像所有绕轨道运行的天体一样，彗星在靠近太阳时移动得更快。因此，它只在我们附近的木星轨道内停留大约一两年。它的大部分时间都花在木星轨道之外，戳戳正因为如此，我们每 75 年只能看到哈雷彗星几个月，首先是它飞向太阳，然后再次离开。现在，你还记得我们之前的讨论吗，彗星的核，它的核心，是由冰和尘埃组成的，就像一个冰冻的雪球。当它接近太阳时，它开始升温。一些冰蒸发成气体从彗核中蒸发出来的气体，彗星再也不会把它们收集回来，所以在每一个轨道上，彗星都会留下自己的一部分。好吧。这个太阳系有多老了？四十亿年了。还记得吗？哈雷彗星每 75 年绕太阳一周，每次都会失去东西。所以彗星现在应该早就消失了，对吧？我的意思是，哈雷怎么还在那儿？四年五亿年后。怎么会这样？好吧，答案是，这颗彗星并不总是处于如此短的周期性轨道上，因为一旦彗星进入一个使其经常靠近太阳的轨道。好吧，那颗彗星可能不会在附近太长了
