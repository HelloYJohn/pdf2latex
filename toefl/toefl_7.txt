CHINE SE POTTERY 
China has one of the world's oldest continuous civilizations-despite invasions and occasional 
foreign rule. A country as vast as China with so long-lasting a civilization has a complex social and 
visual history, within which pottery and porcelain play a major role. 
The function and status of ceramics in China varied from dynasty to dynasty, so they may be 
utilitarian, burial, trade, collectors ', or even ritual objects, according to their quality and the era in 
which they were made. The ceramics fall into three broad types-earthenware, stoneware, and 
porcelain-for vessels, architectural items such as roof tiles, and modeled objects and figures. In 
addition, there was an important group of sculptures made for religious use, the majority of which 
were produced in earthenware. 
The earliest ceramics were fired to earthenware temperatures, but as early as the fifteenth 
century B.C., high-temperature stonewa res were being made with glazed surfaces. During the 
Six Dynasties period (A.D. 265-589), kilns' in north China were producing high-fired ceramics 
of good quality. Whitewares produced in Hebei and Henan provinces from the seventh to the 
tenth centuries evolved into the highly prized porcelains of the Song dynasty (A.D. 960-1279), 
long regarded as one of the high points in the history of China's ceramic industry. The tradition of 
religious sculpture extends over most historical periods but is less clearly delineated than that of 
stonewares or porcelains, for it embraces the old custom of earthenware burial ceramics with later 
religious images and architectural ornament. Ceramic products also include lead-glazed tomb 
models of the Han dynasty, three-color lead-glazed vessels and figures of the Tang dynasty, and 
Ming three-color temple ornaments, in which the motifs were outlined in a raised trail of slip2, 
as well as the many burial ceramics produced in imitation of vessels made in materials of higher 
intrinsic value. 
Trade between the West and the settled and prospero us Chinese dynasties introduced new 
forms and different technologies. One of the most far-reaching examples is the impact of the fine 
ni,:ith-cent ury A.D. Chinese porcelain wares imported into the Arab world. So admired were these 
pieces that they encouraged the development of earthenware made in imitation of porcelain 
and instigated research into the method of their manufactur e. From the Middle East the Chinese 
acquired a blue pigment-a purified form of cobalt oxide unobtainable at that time in China­
that contained only a low level of manganese. Cobalt ores found in China have a high manganese 
content, which produces a more muted blue-gray color. In the seventeenth century, the trading 
activities of the Dutch East India Company resulted in vast quantities of decorated Chinese 
porcelain being brought to Europe, which stimulated and influenced the work of a wide variety of 
wares, notably Delft. The Chinese themselves adapted many specific vessel forms from the West, 
such as bottles with long spouts, and designed a range of decorative patterns especially for the 
European market. 
Just as painted designs on Greek pots may seem today to be purely decorative, whereas in 
fact they were carefully and precisely worked out so that at the time, their meaning was clear, so 
it is with Chinese pots. To twentieth- century eyes, Chinese pottery may appear merely decorative, 
yet to the Chinese the form of each object and its adornment had meaning and significance. The 
dragon represented the emperor, and the phoenix, the empress; the pomegr anate indicated 
fertility, and a pair of fish, happiness; mandarin ducks stood for wedded bliss; the pine tree, p

peach, and crane are emblems of long life; and fish leaping from waves indicated success in the

meanings become obscured or even lost. 
From early times pots were used in both religious and secular contexts. The imperial court 
commissioned work and in the Yuan dynasty (A.O. 1279-1368) an imperial ceramic factory was 
established at Jingdezhen. Pots played an important part in some religious ceremonies. Long and 
often lyrical descriptions of the different types of ware exist that assist in classifying pots, although 
these sometimes confuse an already large and complicated picture.

VARIATIONS IN THE CLIMATE 
One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence 
of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural 
variability of the climate. We know that over the past millennia the climate has undergone major 
changes without any significant human intervent ion. We also know that the global climate system 
is immensely complicated and that everything is in some way connected, and so the system is 
capable of fluctuating in unexpected ways. We need therefore to know how much the climate can 
vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are 
natural as opposed to being the result of human activities. 
Instrumental records do not go back far enough to provide us with reliable measurements of 
global climatic variability on timescales much longer than a century. What we do know is that as 
we include longer time intervals, the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate 
between different regimes. To build up a better picture of fluctuations apprecia bly further back in 
time requires us to use proxy records. 
Over long periods of time, substances whose physical and chemical properties change with 
the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous 
record of changes in those properties over time, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years. 
Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can 
be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred 
from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. Proxy temperature 
records have been reconstructed from ice cores drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite 
shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from 
the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica. 
While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur 
on a global scale, there are nonetheless some intriguing differences, which suggest that the 
pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other. 
What the proxy records make abundantly clear is that there have been significant natural 
changes in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years. Equally striking, however, 
is the relative stability of the climate in the past 10,000 years (the Holocene period). 
To the extent that the coverage of the global climate from these records can provide a measure 
of its true variability, it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have 
combined. These include the chaotic fluctuations of the atmosphere, the slower but equally erratic 
behavior of the oceans, changes in the land surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. Also included 
will be any variations that have arisen from volcanic activity, solar activity, and, possibly, human 
activities . 
One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine 
is by using computer models of the global climate. They can do only so much to represent the 
full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited informat ion about natural 
variability. Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considera bly 
smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records. 
In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself, there is the added factor 
of external influences, such as volcanoes and solar activity. There is a growing body of opinion that p

both these physical variations have a measurable impact on the climate. Thus we need to be able

BEGGING BY NESTLINGS 
Many signals that animals make seem to impose on the signalers costs that are overly 
damaging. A classic example is noisy begging by nestling songbirds when a parent returns to 
the nest with food. These loud cheeps and peeps might give the location of the nest away to a 
listening hawk or raccoon, resulting in the death of the defenseless nestlings. In fact, when tapes 
of begging tree swallows were played at an artificial swallow nest containing an egg, the egg in 
that "noisy" nest was taken or destroyed by predators before the egg in a nearby quiet nest in 
29 of 37 trials. 
Further evidence for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging 
calls of warbler species that nest on the ground versus those that nest in the relative safety of trees. 
The young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of higher frequencies than do 
their tree-nesting relatives. These higher-frequency sounds do not travel as far, and so may better 
conceal the individuals producing them, who are especially vulnerable to predators in their ground 
nests. David Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground beside 
a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting warblers. 
The eggs "advertis ed" by the tree-nesters' begging calls were found bitten significantly more often 
than the eggs associated with the ground-nesters' calls. 
The hypothesis that begging calls have evolved properties that reduce their potential for 
attracting predators yields a prediction : baby birds of species that experience high rates of nest 
predation should produce softer begging signals of higher frequency than nestlings of other 
species less often victimized by nest predators. This prediction was supported by data collected in 
one survey of 24 species from an Arizona forest, more evidence that predator pressure favors the 
evolution of begging calls that are hard to detect and pinpoint. 
Given that predators can make it costly to beg for food, what benefit do begging nestlings 
derive from their communications? One possibility is that a noisy baby bird provides accurate 
signals of its real hunger and good health, making it worthwhile for the listening parent to give it 
food in a nest where several other offspring are usually available to be fed. If this hypothesis is true, 
then it follows that nestlings should adjust the intensity of their signals in relation to the signals 
produced by their nestmates, who are competing for parental attention. When experimentally 
deprived baby robins are placed in a nest with normally fed siblings, the hungry nestlings beg 
more loudly than usual-but so do their better-fed siblings, though not as loudly as the hungrier 
birds. 
If parent birds use begging intensity to direct food to healthy offspring capable of vigorous 
begging, then parents should make food delivery decisions on the basis of their offspring's calls. 
Indeed, if you take baby tree swallows out of a nest for an hour, feeding half the set and starving 
the other half, when the birds are replaced in the nest, the starved youngsters beg more loudly 
than the fed birds, and the parent birds feed the active beggars more than those who beg less 
vigorous ly. 
As these experiments show, begging apparently provides a signal of need that parents use 
to make judgments about which offspring can benefit most from a feeding. But the question 
arises, why don't nestlings beg loudly when they aren't all that hungry? By doing so, they could 
possibly secure more food, which should result in more rapid growth or larger size, either .,�

2 of which is advantageous. The answer lies apparently not in the increased energy costs of 
exaggerated begging -such energy costs are small relative to the potential gain in calories­
but rather in the damage that any successful cheater would do to its siblings, which share genes 
with one another. An individual's success in propagating his or her genes can be affected by 
more than just his or her own personal reproductive success. Because close relatives have many 
of the same genes, animals that harm their close relatives may in effect be destroying some of 
their own genes. Therefore, a begging nestling that secures food at the expense of its siblings 
might actually leave behind fewer copies of its genes overall than it might otherwise.

29 of 37 trials. 
21. According to paragraph 1, the experiment with tapes of begging tree swallows establishes 
which of the following? 
@ Begging by nestling birds can attract the attention of predators to the nest. 
® Nest predators attack nests that contain nestlings more frequent ly than they attack nests 
that contain only eggs. 
© Tapes of begging nestlings attract predators to the nest less frequently than real 
begging calls do. 
® Nest predators have no other means of locating bird nests except the begging calls of 
nestling birds. 
Further evidence for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging 
calls of warbler species that nest on the ground versus those that nest in the relative safety of 
trees. The young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of higher frequencies than 
do their tree-nesting relatives. These higher-frequency sounds do not travel as far, and so may 
better conceal the individuals producing them, who are especially vulnerable to predators in their 
ground nests. David Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground 
beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting 
warblers. The eggs "advertised" by the tree-nesters' begging calls were found bitten significantly 
more often than the eggs associated with the ground-nesters' calls.

23. The experiment described in paragraph 2 supports which of the following conclusions? 
@ Predators are unable to distinguis h between the begging cheeps of ground-nesting and 
those of tree-nesting warblers except by the differing frequencies of the calls. 
® When they can find them, predators prefer the eggs of tree-nesting warblers to those of 
ground-nesting warblers. 
© The higher frequencies of the begging cheeps of ground-nesting warblers are an 
adaptation to the threat that ground-nesting birds face from predators. 
® The danger of begging depends more on the frequency of the begging cheep than on 
how loud it is. 
The hypothesis that begging calls have evolved properties that reduce their potential for 
attracting predators yields a prediction: baby birds of species that experience high rates of nest 
predation should produce softer begging signals of higher frequency than nestlings of other 
species less often victimized by nest predators. This prediction was supported by data collected in 
one survey of 24 species from an Arizona forest, more evidence that predator pressure favors the 
evolution of begging calls that are hard to detect and pinpoint.

Given that predators can make it costly to beg for food, what benefit do begging nestlings 
derive from their communications? One possibility is that a noisy baby bird provides accurate 
signals of its real hunger and good health, making it worthwh ile for the listening parent to give it 
food in a nest where several other offspring are usually available to be fed. If this hypothesis is true, 
then it follows that nestlings should adjust the intensity of their signals in relation to the signals 
produced by their nestmates, who are competing for parental attention. When experimentally 
deprived baby robins are placed in a nest with normally fed siblings, the hungry nestlings beg 
more loudly than usual-but so do their better-fed siblings, though not as loudly as the hungrier 
birds.

Given that predators can make it costly to beg for food, what benefit do begging nestlings 
derive from their commun ications? One possibility is that a noisy baby bird provides accurate 
signals of its real hunger and good health, making it worthwh ile for the listening parent to give it 
food in a nest where several other offspring are usually available to be fed. If this hypothesis is true, 
then it follows that nestlings should adjust the intensity of their signals in relation to the signals 
produced by their nestmates, who are competing for parental attention. When experime ntally 
deprived baby robins are placed in a nest with normally fed siblings, the hungry nestlings beg 
more loudly than usual-but so do their better-fed siblings, though not as loudly as the hungrier 
birds. 
If parent birds use begging intensity to direct food to healthy offspring capable of vigorous 
begging, then parents should make food delivery decisions on the basis of their offspring's calls. 
Indeed, if you take baby tree swallows out of a nest for an hour, feeding half the set and starving 
the other half, when the birds are replaced in the nest, the starved youngsters beg more loudly 
than the fed birds, and the parent birds feed the active beggars more than those who beg less 
vigorously. 
26. In paragraphs 4 and 5, what evidence supports the claim that the intensity of nestling 
begging calls is a good indicator of which offspring in a nest would most benefit from a 
feeding? 
® When placed in a nest with hungry robins, well-fed robins did not beg for food. 
® Among robin nestlings, the intensity of begging decrease d the more the nestlings were fed. 
© Hungry tree swallow nestlings begged louder than well-fed nestlings in the same nest. 
® Hungry tree swallow nestlings continued to beg loudly until they were fed whereas well­
fed nestlings soon stopped begging. 
As these experime nts show, begging apparently provides a signal of need that parents use 
to make judgments about which offspring can benefit most from a feeding. But the question 
arises, why don't nestlings beg loudly when they aren't all that hungry? By doing so, they could 
possibly secure more food, which should result in more rapid growth or larger size, either of which 
is advantageous. The answer lies apparent ly not in the increased energy costs of exaggerated 
begging-suc h energy costs are small relative to the potential gain in calories-but rather in the 
damage that any successful cheater would do to its siblings, which share genes with one another. 
An individual' s success in propagating his or her genes can be affected by more than just his or 
her own personal reproductive success. Because close relatives have many of the same genes, 
animals that harm their close relatives may in effect be destroying some of their own genes. 
Therefore, a begging nestling that secures food at the expense of its siblings might actually leave 
behind fewer copies of its genes overall than it might otherwise. 
27. In paragraph 6, the author compares the energy costs of vigorous begging with the potential 
gain in calories from such begging in order to 
@ explain why begging for food vigorously can lead to faster growth and increased size

28. According to paragraph 6, which of the following explains the fact that a well-fed nestling 
does not beg loudly for more food? 
® There is no benefit for a nestling to get more food than it needs to survive. 
® By begging loudly for food it does not need, a nestling would unnecessari ly expose itself 
to danger from predators. 
© If a nestling begs loudly when it is not truly hungry, then when it is truly hungry its own 
begging may be drowned out by that of its well-fed siblings. 
® More of a nestling's genes will be passed to the next generation if its hungry siblings get 
enough food to survive. 
Many signals that animals make seem to impose on the signalers costs that are overly 
damaging. (A) A classic example is noisy begging by nestling songbirds when a parent returns to 
the nest with food. (8) These loud cheeps and peeps might give the location of the nest away to 
a listening hawk or raccoon, resulting in the death of the defenseless nestlings. (C) In fact, when 
tapes of begging tree swallows were played at an artificial swallow nest containing an egg, the egg 
in that "noisy" nest was taken or destroyed by predators before the egg in a nearby quiet nest in 
29 of 37 trials. (D)

The sea otter is a small mammal that lives in waters along the western coast of North 
America from California to Alaska. When some sea otter populations off the Alaskan coast 
started rapidly declining a few years ago, it caused much concern because sea otters 
play an important ecological role in the coastal ecosystem. Experts started investigating 
the cause of the decline and quickly realized that there were two possible explanations: 
environmental pollution or attacks by predators. Initially, the pollution hypothesis seemed 
the more likely of the two. 
The first reason why pollution seemed the more likely cause was that there were known 
sources of it along the Alaskan coast, such as oil rigs and other sources of industrial chemical 
pollution. Water samples from the area revealed increased levels of chemicals that could 
decrease the otters' resistance to life-threatening infections and thus could indirectly cause 
their deaths. 
Second, other sea mammals such as seals and sea lions along the Alaskan coast were 
also declining, indicating that whatever had endangered the otters was affecting other sea 
mammals as well. This fact again pointed to environmental pollution, since it usually affects 
the entire ecosystem rather than a single species. Only widely occurring predators, such 
as the orca (a large predatory whale), could have the same effect, but orcas prefer to hunt 
much larger prey, such as other whales. 
Third, scientists believed that the pollution hypothesis could also explain the uneven 
pattern of otter decline: at some Alaskan locations the otter populations declined greatly, 
while at others they remained stable. Some experts explained these observations by 
suggesting that ocean currents or other environmental factors may have created uneven 
concentrations of pollutants along the coast. �:;;::;. Writing

1: Paired Choice 
Prompt 
Do you agree or disagree with the following 
statement ? Use details and examples to explain 
your answer. 
All children should be required to learn a 
second language in school. 
Important Points 
When you answer this question, you should 
take a stance and state whether you agree or 
disagree that all children should be required 
to learn a second language in school. In order 
to support your opinion, you should provide at least one specific reason why children should or 
shouldn't be required to learn a second language, 
along with information to elaborate on and 
explain that reason. It is acceptab le to talk about 
more than one reason for agreeing or disagreeing 
with the statement, but you should not simply 
provide a list of reasons without any explanation 
of them.

In this response, the speaker states that she 
agrees with the statement, and although she 
doesn't explicitly say what the statement is, she 
implicitly refers to it throughout her response ("let's 
say, if children don't know English, all degrees now 
required um a second language" and "so I believe 
Eng-like a secon d language it's a benefit and it's a 
plus for kids"). She supports her agreement with 
the statement by explaining specific scenarios 
in which children would benefit from being 
required to learn a second language in school; she 
uses the example of English and the job market, 
saying that most degrees and jobs now require 
English, and also talks about how English will help 
kids communicate when they travel. Although 
her speech is not always smooth (she says "um" 
and hesitates somewhat frequently) and she 
makes some small grammatical errors ("general 
speaking"; "all degrees now required"; "can able to 
communi cate"), it is still easy for the listener to 
understand her.

In this response, the speaker states his 
agreement with the statement but does not 
provide full support for his opinion. Rather than 
choosing one or two reasons and explaining 
them in detail (using a personal experience, 
hypothetical situation, etc.), he lists many 
different and somewhat vague reasons but does 
not provide explanations for them: "because it 
helps really to uh thinks about other stuff''; "you're 
just smarter and you can just have better job''; "it's · i �: · � Answers

has mostly clear pronunciation and uses some 
sophisticated grammatical structures 
("not only the language but also other cultures"), but 
his vague explanations make it somewhat difficult 
for a listener to follow his response. 
2: Fit and Explain 
Prompt 
Briefly summarize the proposal in the student's 
letter. Then state the woman's opinion about the 
proposal and explain the reasons she gives for 
holding that opinion. 
Important Points 
When answering this question, it is important 
to include information from both the reading 
passage and the conversation between students. 
Begin by summarizing the student's proposal, 
which is that the lobby of the student center 
should be selected as the location for a student art 
display. Then indicate the woman's opinion of the 
proposa l and why she feels that way. In this item, 
you would say that the woman disagrees that the 
lobby is a good place for the art displays. She says 
that because there are so many people passing 
through the lobby, it will make it difficult to view 
the artwork. Also, the natural light in the lobby 
is sometimes too bright or too dark for viewing 
artwork (and it is better to have controlled electric 
light).

The speaker accurately and effectively 
covers all the important points. She explains the 
proposal clearly and efficiently, and covers the 
woman's opinion about the natural light with 
great detail. She does a particularly good job 
of organizing her response. For example, after 
she summarizes the letter-writer's proposal, she 
says "these last two points are actually exactly 
the points the woman is criticizing ... " before 
continuing on to the woman's opinion, and this 
transition makes her ideas easy to follow. She 
does not talk as much about how crowding in 
the lobby makes the artwork difficult to view, ,.

but she does mention it in sufficient detail. 
She has a wide vocabulary range, and is able 
to summarize ideas in her own words, such as 
saying "the light is dependent on the weather" to 
summarize the woman's point about natural light. 
Her pronunciation, pacing, and intonation are 
also clear and effective, so it is not difficult for 
listeners to understand her. 
Low-level Response: 
Listen to Track 46. 0 
Rater Comments 
The speaker's response contains relevant 
points, such as using a lobby to display art work, 
the fact that the woman doesn't agree, and an 
explanation for why she doesn't agree. He makes 
some factual errors, however , such as claiming 
the newspaper itself is recommending the new 
location for the artwork. Most importa ntly, 
the response contains some major grammar 
problems that make it difficult to understand. 
For example, the speaker says "the one who is 
going to just appreciate art work will be know it," 
which does not make much sense. Sometimes 
the speaker's pronunciation of individual words 
is difficult to understand as well, such as the 
word "proposal." 
3: General/Specific 
Prompt 
Using the examples from the lecture, explain the 
concept of entertainment merchandis ing. 
Important Points 
For this task, the prompt asks you to use the 
examples from the lecture to explain the concept 
described in the reading. You should begin your 
response by briefly explaining entertainment 
merchand ising (a type of marketing where a 
popular brand or image of one product is used 
to sell another product). For the first example 
from the lecture, you could begin by mentioning 
that entertainment merchandising often 
occurs when children's toys are created based 
on popular characters in a television program 
or movie. For example, the professor and his 
friends bought Action-hero toys because they liked the Action-hero TV show. For the second 
example from the lecture, you could explain that 
entertainment merchandising can also work in a 
reverse way from the first example-sometimes 
TV shows or movies become popular because 
they are based on well-known children's toys. For 
instance, the professor's daughter enjoys playing 
with a doll named Rosa. So, when a TV show 
about Rosa is created, she and her friends begin 
watching it.

At the beginning, the speaker's explanation 
of the concept is a little unclear ("brand or images 
are used to sell"). However, her summary of the 
examples shows that she fully understood how 
the lecture relates to the reading. She does not 
confuse any details, remembering that Action-hero 
was first a television show and then a toy but that 
the Rosa doll was first a toy and then a television 
show. Her pronunc iation is easy to understand, 
and she speaks without pausing or hesitating. She 
uses complex sentences (''And then, they create a 
television show which has the doll Rosa as the main 
character") and shows a good range of vocabulary. 
Mid-level Response: 
Listen to Track 48. 0 
Rater Comments 
The speaker mostly does a good job of 
explaining all the main points of the reading 
and the lecture. Her first sentence, explaining 
the concept of entertainment merchandising, is 
very clear. Her explanation of the Action-hero 
example is also good, but she has significant 
difficulty explaining the example of the Rosa 
doll. For example, she says, "after she was bought 
from all the kids' society," which is unclear. It can 
be inferred from the rest of the response that 
she understands the basic ideas in the lecture, 
but parts of her response are a little confusing. 
Overall, her pronunciation is clear and she speaks 
fluently. She has some minor grammatical errors, 
but she is still easy to understand. 4:Summary 
Prompt 
Using the points from the lecture, explain why 
researchers think that babies may feel empathy. 
Important Points 
In this item, your summary of the key ideas 
from the lecture should include that researchers 
believe that babies are capable of feeling 
empathy. They think this because they did an 
experim ent where a baby listened to other babies 
crying. The baby cried when he heard the other 
babies crying (which is what they expected). 
However, when the researchers played the baby 
a tape of his own crying, he didn't cry. This told 
researchers that noise wasn't the cause of the 
crying. Rather, it suggested that the baby cried 
because he felt empathy or concern for the other 
babies.

The speaker gives a clear summary of the 
lecture, starting with a statement of what 
researchers believed until now and then 
explaining what was found in the experiment. 
She doesn't say explicitly that the researchers 
played a recording or tape of babies crying, and 
she also mispronoun ces the word "experim ent."

These are minor errors, however, and do not 
prevent the listener from understan ding what 
happened in the experiment. One of the 
speaker's particular strengths is that she places 
emphasis on certain words to help communi cate 
the difference between the two parts of the 
experiment (" ... it's not the actual noise that 
triggers the baby's reflex to cry, but actually an 
emotional feeling"). 
Mid-level Response:

Rater Comments 
In this response, the speaker gives a basic 
summary of both parts of the experiment. Her 
pronunciation is also quite clear. However, she 
hesitates often while searching for words to 
describe what happened in the experiment. These 
pauses and the limits in her vocabulary prevent her 
from making the final connection and explaining 
why the results of the experiment led researchers 
to believe that babies feel empathy. The point isn't, 
as the speaker says, that babies can "differentiate" 
between their own cries and those of other babies. 
The point is that the baby only cried when he heard 
the other babies cry, which made researchers think 
that noise wasn't an issue, but rather that he felt 
concern for the other babies. Overall, the response 
is slightly confusing to the listener because of these 
missing pieces and lack of organization. 
The responses are followed by comments from

Question 1 
Prompt 
Summarize the points made in the lecture, 
being sure to explain how they respond to the 
specific points made in the reading passage. 
Topic Notes 
The reading discusses three reasons to believe 
it is because of pollution that there has been a decline of sea otters off of Alaska and California, 
while the lecture discusses why predation, 
Point made in the read ing 
The passage argues that increased levels of pollution 
detected along the Alaskan coast could cause the 
deaths of sea otters by making them vulnerable to 
infections. 
The decline of other sea mammals (seals and sea lions) 
points to a systemic cause such as pollution; the orca, 
a predator that could conceivably hunt several sea 
mammal species, is not the likely cause because it 
prefers larger prey such as whales. 
The decline of sea otter populations is greater in some 
locations than in others, which again seems consistent 
with the pollution theory since varying concentrat ions 
of pollutants could account for such an uneven 
pattern. 
Responses with scores of 4 and 5 typically 
discuss all three points in the table with good 
accuracy. 
Sample Response 
The topic discussed here is the investigation 
of the causes of the disappearance of the sea otter, 
which is a small mammal that lives in waters along 
the western coast of North America from California 
to Alaska. The woman in the lecture argues that the 
cause of their disappearance is the presence of the 
predators, especially orcas, and not pollution as the 
reading says. 
Firstly, she argues that one of the proofs of 
their being attacked by the predators is the fact 
that no one can find any dead sea otters. If the 
cause was the pollution, many dead sea otters 
would be found along the shores. In addition, a 
predator will immediately eat its prey so this is 
why no dead sea otters were found. 
Secondly, the woman in the lecture argues 
there is another explanation than pollution why 
smaller sea mammals are all disappearing. She says 
that, since the whales tend to disappear because of 
the humans hunting them, the areas had to adapt especially by areas, is a better explanat ion of the 
evidence presente d in the reading. 
Corresponding point from the lecture 
No dead sea otters have been found washed up 
on shore; this weakens the pollution theory but 
supports the predator theory, since the predators 
would eat the otters as they caught them, leaving no 
remains. 
Since the population of whales that areas prefer to 
hunt has declined, areas started hunting smaller prey, 
such as otters, as well as seals and sea lions. 
The uneven pattern of sea otter decline can be 
explained by the fact that some locations where sea 
otters live are accessible to areas and some are not; 
the accessible areas experience decline, while the 
populations in the inaccessible areas remain steady. 
their food habits to the sea conditions and as a result 
they have started eating the smaller sea animals 
available among them sea otters being included. 
Thirdly, she argues that the areas cannot access 
the shallow locations. This is why there are some 
areas where the sea otters are numerous. It's not 
because of uneven concentrat ions of pollutants. 
Rater Comments 
This response earns a score of 5. The response 
clearly conveys the three points from the lecture 
showing why predation by areas is a better 
explanat ion than pollution for why no remains of 
the sea otters are found, for why a number of small 
animals including the sea otter started declining 
at the same time, and for why sea otter decline 
seems to have occurred to a lesser extent or not at 
all in some places, and to a greater extent in others. 
Gramma tical errors are few and minor. 
Question 2 
Prompt 
Do you agree or disagree with the following 
statement? 
Playing computer games is a waste of time. 
Children should not be allowed to play them. Use specific reasons and examples to support 
your answer. 
Topic Notes 
This topic asks you whether children should be 
banned from playing computer games. Successful 
responses can agree with the statement, disagree 
with the statement, or show the merits of both 
positions. No matter which position you take, it is 
important to support your opinion with details and 
examples. 
If you agree with the statement, you might 
discuss why alternative activities, for example, 
playing physical games and getting exercise, 
are better for children rather than sitting at a 
computer or you might talk about social skills that 
can be obtained only by interacting face-to-face 
with other children. You could also talk about 
negative aspects of some computer games, such as 
addiction to game playing or the violence depicted 
in some games, and how some might worry about 
fantasy transferring to real life. 
On the other side, you might want to argue 
that games are a positive way to train children 
to analyze events and organize their reactions. 
For example, computer games can be good for 
learning logic and practicing certain academic or 
athletic skills. Skill at computer games can also be 
a source of pride for children who might not be 
recognized for their achievements at school or on 
sports teams. 
Sample Response 
I disagree with statement that children should 
not be allowed to play computer games; it is not a 
waste of time. Lots of new skills and ideas can be 
developed through games and children should be 
encouraged to play games throughout their life. 
These days computer games can really enhance 
learning, help the development of manual and 
physical skills and even promote bonding people 
together. 
I see computer games as new tools of learning 
for children. With development of computer 
games industry, more and more games are focused 
on mental development of children. Through 
computer games children can learn new languages 
by using games that understand and produce voice ',:.1 ....... 
�!.'." _. Answer s 
;j,,;t_ ·:.,,. 
and text. And most importantly, they can interact 
with the computer game at their convinience at 
home. Therefore they can spend a lot more time 
using and developing language skills through 
computer games than just learning them during 
school time. 
Computer and tablet games can also be very 
helpful! for learning math and algebra. There are 
many math games for preschoolers that capture 
kids' attentions because they are very attractive 
using sound and graphics and never get tired of 
teaching. And then there're higher level stand 
alone games and websites that have games that 
help students to absorb much more complex ideas 
like algebra and geometry, in a fun way. 
Another good thing about some games is 
they can be used to develop manual and physical 
skills for children. By using different computer 
equipment and game programs, children can learn 
to, for example, drive a vehicle or even fly a plane. 
Other games and advance equipment let children 
practice sport moves just like they were playing 
sport for real. So these games can help develop 
movement, coordination, and ability to see and 
react to things in motion. 
And finally, children can play games on-line 
in real time with chat. They can do this with other 
children located at a distance in their country or 
even anywhere in the world. As they play these 
online games with chat, they can talk to each other 
about almost anything. This can lead them to 
develop new kinds of friendships and international 
understanding and make their existing relations 
stronger. 
Of course as in everthing, games should have 
their limits. But from all I have argued above, 
computer games are and should be part of 
children's daily life.

This 5-level response disagrees with the

games.
