MINERALS AND PLANTS 
Research has shown that certain minerals are required by plants for normal growth and 
development. The soil is the source of these minerals, which are absorbed by the plant with the 
water from the soil. Even nitrogen, which is a gas in its elemental state, is normally absorbed from 
the soil as nitrate ions. Some soils are notoriously deficient in micro nutrients and are therefore 
unable to support most plant life. So-called serpentine soils, for example, are deficient in calcium, 
and only plants able to tolerate low levels of this mineral can survive. In modern agriculture, 
mineral depletion of soils is a major concern, since harvesting crops interrupts the recycling of 
nutrients back to the soil. 
Mineral deficiencies can often be detected by specific symptoms such as chlorosis (loss of 
chlorophyll resulting in yellow or white leaf tissue), necrosis (isolated dead patches), anthocyanin 
formation (development of deep red pigmentation of leaves or stem), stunted growth, and 
development of woody tissue in an herbaceous plant. Soils are most commonly deficient in 
nitrogen and phosphorus. Nitrogen- deficient plants exhibit many of the symptoms just described. 
Leaves develop chlorosis; stems are short and slender; and anthocyanin discoloration occurs on 
stems, petioles, and lower leaf surfaces. Phosphorus-deficient plants are often stunted, with leaves 
turning a characteristic dark green, often with the accumulation of anthocyanin. Typically, older 
leaves are affected first as the phosphorus is mobilized to young growing tissue. Iron deficiency is 
characterized by chlorosis between veins in young leaves. 
Much of the research on nutrient deficiencies is based on growing plants hydroponically, that 
is, in soilless liquid nutrient solutions. This technique allows researchers to create solutions that 
selectively omit certain nutrients and then observe the resulting effects on the plants. Hydroponics 
has applications beyond basic research, since it facilitates the growing of greenhouse vegetables 
during winter. Aeroponics, a technique in which plants are suspended and the roots misted with a 
nutrient solution, is another method for growing plants without soil. 
While mineral deficiencies can limit the growth of plants, an overabundance of certain 
minerals can be toxic and can also limit growth. Saline soils, which have high concentrations of 
sodium chloride and other salts, limit plant growth, and research continues to focus on developing 
salt-tolerant varieties of agricultural crops. Research has focused on the toxic effects of heavy 
metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and aluminum; however, even copper and zinc, which are 
essential elements, can become toxic in high concentrations. Although most plants cannot survive 
in these soils, certain plants have the ability to tolerate high levels of these minerals . 
Scientists have known for some time that certain plants, called hyperaccum ulators, can 
concentrate minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than normal. A survey of known 
hyperaccumulators identified that 75 percent of them amassed nickel; cobalt, copper, zinc, 
manganese, lead, and cadmium are other minerals of choice. Hyperaccumulators run the entire 
range of the plant world. They may be herbs, shrubs, or trees. Many members of the mustard 
family, spurge family, legume family, and grass family are top hyperaccumulators. Many are found 
in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, where accumulation of high concentrations of metals 
may afford some protection against plant-eating insects and microbial pathogens. 
Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to clean up soil and waste sites 
that have been contaminated by toxic levels of heavy metals-an environmentally friendly approach p

known as phytoremediation. This scenario begins with the planting of hyperaccumu lating species 
in the target area, such as an abandoned mine or an irrigation pond contaminated by runoff. Toxic 
minerals would first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the stem and leaves. A harvest of 
the shoots would remove the toxic compounds off site to be burned or composted to recover the 
metal for industrial uses. After several years of cultivation and harvest, the site would be restored at 
a cost much lower than the price of excavation and reburial, the standard practice for remediation 
of contaminated soils. For example, in field trials, the plant alpine pennycress removed zinc and 
cadmium from soils near a zinc smelter, and Indian mustard, native to Pakistan and India, has been 
effective in reducing levels of selenium salts by 50 percent in contaminated soils.

THE ORIGIN OF THE PACIFIC ISLAND PEOPLE 
The greater Pacific region, traditionally called Oceania, consists of three cultural areas: 
Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Melanesia, in the southwest Pacific, contains the large 
islands of New Guinea, the Solomons, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. Micronesia, the area north of 
Melanesia, consists primarily of small scattered islands. Polynesia is the central Pacific area in the 
great triangle defined by Hawaii, Easter Island, and New Zealand. Before the arrival of Europeans, 
the islands in the two largest cultural areas, Polynesia and Micronesia, together contained a 
population estimated at 700,000. 
Speculation on the origin of these Pacific islanders began as soon as outsiders encountered 
them; in the absence of solid linguistic, archaeological, and biological data, many fanciful and 
mutually exclusive theories were devised. Pacific islanders were variously thought to have come 
from North America, South America, Egypt, Israel, and India, as well as Southeast Asia. Many 
older theories implicitly deprecated the navigational abilities and overall cultural creativity of 
the Pacific islanders. For example, British anthropologists G. Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry assumed 
that only Egyptians would have been skilled enough to navigate and colonize the Pacific. They 
speculated that the Egyptians even crossed the Pacific to found the great civilizations of the New 
World (North and South America). In 1947 Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl drifted on a 
balsa-log raft westward with the winds and currents across the Pacific from South America to 
prove his theory that Pacific islanders were Native Americans (also called American Indians). Later 
Heyerdahl suggested that the Pacific was peopled by three migrations: by Native Americans from 
the Pacific Northwest of North America drifting to Hawaii, by Peruvians drifting to Easter Island, 
and by Melanesians. In 1969 he crossed the Atlantic in an Egyptian-style reed boat to prove 
Egyptian influences in the Americas. Contrary to these theorists, the overwhelming evidence of 
physical anthropology , linguistics, and archaeology shows that the Pacific islanders came from 
Southeast Asia and were skilled enough as navigators to sail against the prevailing winds and 
currents. 
The basic cultural requirements for the successful colonization of the Pacific islands include 
the appropriate boat-building, sailing, and navigation skills to get to the islands in the first place; 
domesticated plants and gardening skills suited to often marginal conditions; and a varied inventory 
of fishing implements and techniques. It is now generally believed that these prerequisites 
originated with peoples speaking Austronesian languages (a group of several hundred related 
languages) and began to emerge in Southeast Asia by about 5000 B.C.E. The culture of that time, 
based on archaeology and linguistic reconstruction, is assumed to have had a broad inventory of 
cultivated plants including taro, yams, banana, sugarcane, breadfruit, coconut, sago, and rice. Just 
as important, the culture also possessed the basic foundation for an effective maritime adaptation, 
including outrigger canoes and a variety of fishing techniques that could be effective for overseas 
voyaging. 
Contrary to the arguments of some that much of the Pacific was settled by Polynesians 
accidentally marooned after being lost and adrift, it seems reasonable that this feat was 
accomplished by deliberate colonization expeditions that set out fully stocked with food and 
domesticated plants and animals. Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer 
simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most unlikely means of colonizing the p

2 Pacific. These expeditions were likely driven by population growth and political dynamics on the 
home islands, as well as the challenge and excitement of exploring unknown waters. Because all 
Polynesians, Micronesians, and many Melanesians speak Austronesian languages and grow crops 
derived from Southeast Asia, all these peoples most certainly derived from that region and not the 
New World or elsewhere. The undisputed pre-Columbian presence in Oceania of the sweet potato, 
which is a New World domesticate, has sometimes been used to support Heyerdahl's "American 
Indians in the Pacific" theories. However, this is one plant out of a long list of Southeast Asian 
domesticates. As Patrick Kirch, an American anthropologist, points out, rather than being brought 
by rafting South Americans, sweet potatoes might just have easily been brought back by returning 
Polynesian navigators who could have reached the west coast of South America.

THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION 
The geologic timescale is marked by significant geologic and biological events, including 
the origin of Earth about 4.6 billion years ago, the origin of life about 3.5 billion years ago, the 
origin of eukaryotic life-forms (living things that have cells with true nuclei) about 1.5 billion years 
ago, and the origin of animals about 0.6 billion years ago. The last event marks the beginning of 
the Cambrian period. Animals originated relatively late in the history of Earth-in only the last 10 
percent of Earth's history. During a geologically brief 100-million-year period, all modern animal 
groups (along with other animals that are now extinct) evolved. This rapid origin and diversification 
of animals is often referred to as "the Cambrian explosion." 
Scientists have asked important questions about this explosion for more than a century. Why 
did it occur so late in the history of Earth? The origin of multicellular forms of life seems a relatively 
simple step compared to the origin of life itself. Why does the fossil record not document the series 
of evolutionary changes during the evolution of animals? Why did animal life evolve so quickly? 
Paleontologists continue to search the fossil record for answers to these questions. 
One interpretation regarding the absence of fossils during this important 100-million-year 
period is that early animals were soft bodied and simply did not fossilize. Fossilization of soft-bodied 
animals is less likely than fossilization of hard-bodied animals, but it does occur. Conditions that 
promote fossilization of soft-bodied animals include very rapid covering by sediments that create 
an environment that discourages decomposition. In fact, fossil beds containing soft-bodied 
animals have been known for many years. 
The Ediacara fossil formation, which contains the oldest known animal fossils, consists 
exclusively of soft-bodied forms. Although named after a site in Australia, the Ediacara formation 
is worldwide in distribution and dates to Precambrian times. This 700-million-year-old formation 
gives few clues to the origins of modern animals, however, because paleontologists believe it 
represents an evolutionary experiment that failed. It contains no ancestors of modern animal 
groups. 
A slightly younger fossil formation containing animal remains is the Tommotian formation, 
named after a locale in Russia. It dates to the very early Cambrian period, and it also contains only 
soft-bodied forms. At one time, the animals present in these fossil beds were assigned to various 
modern animal groups, but most paleontologists now agree that all Tommotian fossils represent 
unique body forms that arose in the early Cambrian period and disappeared before the end of the

A third fossil formation containing both soft-bodied and hard-bodied animals provides 
evidence of the result of the Cambrian explosion. This fossil formation, called the Burgess Shale, is in 
Yoho National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. Shortly after the Cambrian 
explosion, mud slides rapidly buried thousands of marine animals under conditions that favored 
fossilization. These fossil beds provide evidence of about 32 modern animal groups, plus about 
20 other animal body forms that are so different from any modern animals that they cannot be 
assigned to any one of the modern groups. These unassignable animals include a large swimming 
predator called Anomalocaris and a soft-bodied animal called Wiwaxia, which ate detritus or algae.

p groups. For example, a well-known Burgess Shale animal called Sidneyia is a representative of a 
previously unknown group of arthropods (a category of animals that includes insects, spiders, mites, 
and crabs). 
Fossil formations like the Burgess Shale show that evolution cannot always be thought of as 
a slow progression. The Cambrian explosion involved rapid evolutionary diversification, followed 
by the extinction of many unique animals. Why was this evolution so rapid? No one really knows. 
Many zoologists believe that it was because so many ecological niches were available with virtually 
no competition from existing species. Will zoologists ever know the evolutionary sequences in the 
Cambrian explosion? Perhaps another ancient fossil bed of soft-bodied animals from 600-million­
year-old seas is awaiting discovery.

The geologic timescale is marked by significant geologic and biological events, including 
the origin of Earth about 4.6 billion years ago, the origin of life about 3.5 billion years ago, the 
origin of eukaryotic life-forms (living things that have cells with true nuclei) about 1.5 billion years 
ago, and the origin of animals about 0.6 billion years ago. The last event marks the beginning 
of the Cambrian period. Animals originated relatively late in the history of Earth-in only the 
last 10 percent of Earth's history. During a geologically brief 100-million-year period, all modern 
animal groups (along with other animals that are now extinct) evolved. This rapid origin and 
diversification of animals is often referred to as "the Cambrian explosion."

Scientists have asked important questions about this explosion for more than a century. 
Why did it occur so late in the history of Earth? The origin of multicellular forms of life seems 
a relatively simple step compared to the origin of life itself. Why does the fossil record not 
document the series of evolutionary changes during the evolution of animals? Why did animal 
life evolve so quickly? Paleontolog ists continue to search the fossil record for answers to these 
questions. 
One interpretation regarding the absence of fossils during this important 100-million-year 
period is that early animals were soft bodied and simply did not fossilize. Fossili zation of soft-bodied 
animals is less likely than fossilization of hard-bodied animals, but it does occur. Conditions that 
promote fossilization of soft-bodied animals include very rapid covering by sediments that create 
an environment that discourages decomposition. In fact, fossil beds containing soft-bodied 
animals have been known for many years. 
22. Which of the following best describes the relationship between paragraph 2 and paragraph 3? 
@ Paragraph 2 puts forward several scientific claims, one of which is rejected in paragraph 3. 
® Paragraph 2 poses several questions, and paragraph 3 offers a possible answer to one of 
them. 
© Paragraph 2 presents outdated traditional views, while paragraph 3 presents the current 
scientific conclusions.

The Ediacara fossil formation, which contains the oldest known animal fossils, consists 
exclusively of soft-bodied forms. Although named after a site in Australia, the Ediacara formation 
is worldwide in distribution and dates to Precambrian times. This 700-million-year-old formation 
gives few clues to the origins of modern animals, however, because paleontologists believe it 
represents an evolutionary experiment that failed. It contains no ancestors of modern animal 
groups. 
24. Which of the following is NOT mentioned in paragraph 4 as being true of the Ediacara 
formation? 
@ It contains fossils that date back to the Precambrian period.

A slightly younger fossil formation containing animal remains is the Tommotian formation, 
named after a locale in Russia. It dates to the very early Cambrian period, and it also contains only 
soft-bodied forms. At one time, the animals present in these fossil beds were assigned to various 
modern animal groups, but most paleontologists now agree that all Tommotian fossils represent 
unique body forms that arose in the early Cambrian period and disappeared before the end of the 
period, leaving no descendants in modern animal groups. 
25. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted 
sentence in paragraph 5? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave 
out essential information. 
® The animals found in the Tommotian fossil bed were once thought to belong to a variety of 
modern animal groups, but now they are thought to have descended from a single group. 
® Animals in the Tommotian fossil beds were initially assigned to modern animal groups 
but are now thought to belong to groups that emerged and died out during the 
Cambrian period. 
© Though at first they thought otherwise, paleontologists now agree that the animals in the 
Tommotian formation have body forms from which modern animals have descended. 
® It is unclear whether the Tommotian fossils from the early Cambrian period represent 
unique body forms or whether they should be assigned to various modern animal groups. 
A third fossil formation containing both soft-bodied and hard-bodied animals provides 
evidence of the result of the Cambrian explosion. This fossil formation, called the Burgess Shale, 
is in Yoho National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. Shortly after the

of modern animal groups. For example, a well-known Burgess Shale animal called Sidneyia is a 
representative of a previously unknown group of arthropods (a category of animals that includes

26. Why does the author mention "Anomalocaris" and "Wiwaxia"? 
® To contrast predators with animals that eat plants such as algae 
® To question the effects of rapid mud slides on fossilization 
© To suggest that much is still unknown about animals found in the Burgess Shale 
® To provide examples of fossils that cannot be assigned to a modern animal group

28. What can be inferred from paragraph 7 about why the Cambrian explosion is so unusual? 
® It gener ated new ecological niches through the extinction of many unique animals. 
® It was a period of ra pid evolution, and evolution is often thought of as a slow process. 
© It is a period whose evolutionary sequences are clearly marked.

Answer Cho ices 
[Kl The Cambrian period is significant because it marks the emergence of eukaryotic 
life-forms-organisms that have cells with true nuclei. 
[[] Little is known about the stages of evolution during the Cambrian period, in part 
because early animals were soft bodied and could fossilize only under particular 
conditions. 
[TI The Ediacara fossil formation provides the most information about the Cambrian 
explosion, while the earlier Tommotian and Burgess Shale formations give clues about 
Precambrian evolution. 
[Q] While animal fossils from before the Cambrian explosion have no modern descendants, 
many animals that evolved during the Cambrian explosion can be assigned to modern 
groups. 
[I] Zoologists are awaiting the discovery of a 600-million-year-old fossil formation in order 
to be able to form a theory of how animal evolution progressed. 
[I] Although the reasons for the rapid evolution of animals during the Cambrian period are not 
known, one proposed explanation is an abundance of niches with a lack of competitors. LISTE

about their products to large, general audiences; it was once thought that the best way 
to sell a product was to advertise it to as many people as possible. However, more recent 
trends in advertising have turned toward target marketing. Target marketing is the strategy 
of advertising to smaller, very specific audiences-audiences that have been determined

Reading Time: 3 minutes 
As early as the twelfth century A.D., the settlements of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico in 
the American Southwest were notable for their "great houses," massive stone buildings that 
contain hundreds of rooms and often stand three or four stories high. Archaeologists have been 
trying to determine how the buildings were used. While there is still no universally agreed upon 
explanation, there are three competing theories. 
One theory holds that the Chaco structures were purely residential, with each housing 
hundreds of people. Supporters of this theory have interpreted Chaco great houses as earlier 
versions of the architecture seen in more recent Southwest societies. In particular, the Chaco 
houses appear strikingly similar to the large, well-known "apartment buildings" at Taos, New 
Mexico, in which many people have been living for centuries. 
A second theory contends that the Chaco structures were used to store food supplies. One 
of the main crops of the Chaco people was grain maize, which could be stored for long periods 
of time without spoiling and could serve as a long-lasting supply of food. The supplies of maize 
had to be stored somewhere, and the size of the great houses would make them very suitable 
for the purpose. 
A third theory proposes that houses were used as ceremonial centers. Close to one house, 
called Pueblo Alto, archaeologists identified an enormous mound formed by a pile of old 
material. Excavations of the mound revealed deposits containing a surprisingly large number of 
broken pots. This finding has been interpreted as evidence that people gathered at Pueblo Alto 
for special ceremonies. At the ceremonies, they ate festive meals and then discarded the pots 
in which the meals had been prepared or served. Such ceremonies have been documented for 
other Native American cultures.

Speaking Section 
1. To respond to this particular question, 
you should clearly state what your opinion is 
regarding the statement. Be sure to read the 
statement carefully to make sure you understand 
it. In this case, you would either agree or disagree 
that studying math or science is more important 
than studying art or literature. You should then 
give reasons to support your opinion. If you 
agree that math or science is more important, 
you might say that they are used in many 
important areas, such as engineering, and are 
necessary to make calculations when building 
structures, for example. You could also provide a 
personal example and say that you prefer math 
because it has helped you in certain situations, 
such as planning your personal finances. You 
may also want to make a statement about how 
art has not helped you as much. 
If you disagree with the statement, you would 
also need to support this with specific information . 
One possibility is to say that math and science are not 
actually important because not many people need 
to know math very well. Most people need to know 27.

only a little math or science to do their jobs. Then you 
should provide an example of why art or literature 
is more important. There are many possibilities, and 
the specific example you choose is not important as 
long as it contributes to your argument. Your goal 
is for your listener to understand why you agree or 
disagree with the statement. 
Your response should be intelligible, should 
demonstrate effective use of grammar and 
vocabulary, and should be well developed and 
coherent. Your response is scored using the 
Independent Speaking Rubric (see Appendix A). 
2. First, as the question states, you should 
provide a brief summary of the university's plan 
from the reading, which is to offer meals prepared 
by culinary arts students at the dining hall. You 
can also provide a brief summary of the reason 
that they are doing this, which is to provide 
culinary arts students with some experienc e. You 
should not, however , spend too much time on this 
summary. Your summary should be clear enough 
for the listener to understand the plan without 
having access to additional information. After the summar y, you should state the man's 
opinion of the university's plan. In this case, the man 
agrees with the universit y's proposal. 
You should then convey the two main reasons 
he gives for holding that opinion. You will need to 
connect information from the conversation to the 
reading in order for the response to be complete. 
The man says that he agrees that a dining club 
will be good experience for culinary arts students 
because cooking for many people under pressure 
is different from cooking for classmates. You should 
go beyond simply saying that the man agrees that 
it will be good experience . You need to give the 
explanation for why he believes that. 
Your response should also convey the man's 
second reason for agreeing with the university's 
plan. The man agrees that the extra cost students 
will pay for these dinners will be worth it. He 
believes this because the culinary arts students will 
cook meals that are as good as those served in nice 
restaurants in the area. 
You should manage your time so that you 
are able to discuss the summar y and give a full 
description of both reasons that the man provides. 
Your response should be intelligible, should 
demonstrate effective use of grammar and 
vocabulary, and should be well developed and 
coherent. Your response is scored using the 
Integrate d Speaking Rubric (see Appen dix A). 
3. To respond to this particular question you 
should first explain the technique of target 
marketing as it was presente d in the reading. 
Target marketing is designing or creating 
advertising so that it appeals to a specific group of 
people. 
You should then use the example given by the 
professor to explain the technique. The professor 
discusses how a telephone company may produce 
two very different advertisements to be shown 
during different television programs, even though 
the phone is basically the same. A commercia l 
shown during young people's programming, such 
as a music show, would appeal to their interests, 
and would show how the phone is fun. On the 
other hand, a commercia l shown during a business 
program would emphasize factors important to 4. businesspe ople, such as efficienc y. This example 
by the professor illustrates the concept of target 
marketing. 
You do not need to repeat all of the details 
from the reading and the lecture, but instead 
integrate points from both to answer the question 
completely. 
Your response should be intelligible, should 
demonstrate effective use of grammar and 
vocabulary, and should be well developed and 
coherent. Your response is scored using the 
Integrate d Speaking Rubric (see Appendix A). 
This particular question requires you to 
summarize the contents of a lecture you hear. 
In your response, you should talk about the two 
different kinds of motivation, which are extrinsic 
(or external) motivation and intrinsic (or internal) 
motivation. You should include relevant points and 
examples from the lecture (and not from any other 
source). 
To begin your response, you should briefly 
state the main idea, that there are two types of 
motivation, and name the two types. You would 
then talk about the first type, extrinsic motivation. 
You would explain that when we are externally 
motivated, we do something for an external reward. 
You would then talk about the professor's example 
of a child doing household chores for an allowance. 
The money that the child receives is motivation. 
You would next talk about the second type, 
extrinsic motivation. You would explain that when 
we are internally motivated, we do something 
because it makes us feel good. You should then 
discuss the professor's example. The professor 
goes to the gym several times a week because it's 
good for her health and she enjoys it. You could 
then say that she has gone for several years, which 
shows that intrinsic motivation is long lasting. Y ou 
do not, however, need to repeat all of the details 
from the lecture. You need to give only sufficient 
details to explain the types of motivation. You 
should plan your time so that you have enough 
time to cover both types of motivation and their 
examples. 
Your response should be intelligible, should 
demonstrate effective use of grammar and TOEFL iBT® Test 2 ,t 
'; 
vocabulary , and should be well developed and 
coherent. Your response is scored using the 
Integrated Speaking Rubric (see Appendix A). 
Writing Section 
1. What is important to understand from the 
lecture is that the professor disagrees with each 
of the theories presented in the reading about the 
function of the massive stone buildings, or "great 
Point made in the reading 
The Chaco houses may have been used for residential 
purposes, because they are similar to residential 
buildings built by other societies in the American 
Southwest. 
The Chaco houses may have been used to store food. 
The Chaco people needed a place to store their grain 
maize, and the Chaco houses, thanks to their large 
capacity, could serve that purpose. 
The Chaco houses may have served as ceremonial 
centers. The large quantity of broken pottery in a 
mound located near the "Pueblo Alto" house suggests 
that the houses hosted ceremonial feasts after which 
people discarded the pots in which the food was 
prepared and served. 
Your response is scored using the Integrated 
Writing Rubric (see Appendix A). A response that 
receives a score of 5 clearly conveys all three of the 
main points in the table using accurate sentence 
structure and vocabulary . 
2. To earn a top score, you should develop a 
multi-paragraph essay that responds to the issue 
of whether people today spend too much time 
on personal enjoyment-doing things they like 
to do-rather than doing things they should 
do. Typically an effective response will contain a 
minimum of 300 words. houses," of Chaco Canyon, namely that the great 
houses served a residential purpose; that they 
were used to store food supplies; and that they 
were used to hold ceremonies. 
In your response, you should convey the 
reasons presented by the professor for why 
the theories about the function of the Chaco 
great houses are not convincing. A high-scoring 
response will include the following points made 
by the professor that cast doubt on the points 
made in the reading: 
Counterpoint made in the lecture 
It is unlikely that the Chaco houses were residential, 
because they contain very few fireplaces, many fewer 
than the families living in the houses would need for 
cooking. 
The theory that the function of the Chaco houses was 
to store grain maize is undermined by the fact that 
very few traces of maize or maize containers have 
been found during excavations of the Chaco houses. 
The mound near the "Pueblo Alto" house also 
contains construction materials and tools, which 
suggests that such mounds were just construction 
trash heaps and had nothing to do with ceremonies. 
The pots found in the mounds were probably used by 
construction workers building the houses. 
One successful way to express agreement 
with the prompt is to argue that people these 
days are not spending their time on tasks that are 
meaningful, but instead are wasting their time 
on pleasurable but less meaningful activities. 
Defining what meaningful versus less meaningful 
activities are for you personally 
is important for this strategy; keep in 
mind that social networking, for example, might 
be a complete waste of time to 
you, but may be quite meaningful for 
others. A successful way to disagree with the prompt 
is to explain that people nowadays work very 
hard at doing the things they should do-for 
example, in many places, people are spending 
more hours than ever at their jobs, because that 
is what the companies they work for say they 
should do-so whatever time they devote to 
personal enjoyment is not "too much," but rather 
is exactly what's needed to maintain their health 
and happiness in light of all those hours spent on 
the job. 
Keep in mind that there is no "correct" 
answer to this question. Either side of the issue 
can be supported with examples and reasons. 
It is important to make sure that you state your 
opinion and develop a response that explains 
your opinion well. The development of your essay is judged by how effectively you support 
your opinion; a well-developed essay will contain 
clearly appropriate reasons, examples, and details 
that illustrate your opinion. Development is not 
evaluated simply in terms of how many words 
you write. 
Your response should be well organized. 
A well-organized essay allows an evaluator to 
read from the beginning to the end of the essay 
without becoming confused. You should be 
sure not to just repeat the same information in 
different ways. 
The quality and accuracy of the sentence 
structure and vocabulary you use to express your 
ideas is also very important. 
Your response is scored using the Independent 
Writing Rubric (see Appendix A).
